After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father.Buffett showcased an interest in business and investing at a young age. He was inspired by a book he borrowed from the Omaha public library at age seven, One Thousand Ways to Make $1000. Much of Buffett\\'s early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. In one of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, Coca-Cola, and weekly magazines door to door. He worked in his grandfather\\'s grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. On his first income tax return in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route. In 1945, as a high school sophomore, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used pinball machine, which they placed in the local barber shop.

He is the youngest son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\nBuffett began his musical career in the early part of the 1980s in San Francisco, California. After dropping out of Stanford University, he used the proceeds of his inheritance from his grandfather to pursue a career in music. He recorded and produced albums for local talent.  His big break came when a neighbor introduced him to his son-in-law who needed ad tunes for a newly conceived station, MTV. The music channel became a cultural phenomenon in the 1980s. He also was hired by ad agencies to compose commercials and logos - including CNN, which like MTV was also new to cable television at the time.\\n\\n\\n=== Music career ===\\n\\n\\n==== 1987–1995 ====\\nBuffett decided to transition from ad to music and he decided that a way to do that is to get a record deal based on movie scores. As new age music was popular in the mid-1980s, he was able to secure one. Narada Productions, a new-age music recording company, signed Buffett to a recording contract.  In 1987, Buffett debuted with Narada, releasing an album entitled The Waiting.  His second album, One by One, was inspired by Evan S. Connell\\'s book \"Son of the Morning Star\". In 1989, Buffett moved to Milwaukee, home of Narada Productions and closer to his childhood home in Omaha, Nebraska.  Buffett would release two more albums with Narada:  Lost Frontier and Yonnondio.\\nWhile with Narada, Buffett had his first major success scoring the \"Fire Dance\" scene in the film Dances with Wolves.  The film score, composed by John Barry, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Barry would later invite Buffett to collaborate with him again, this time at the Abbey Road Studios in London.  Buffett contributed the Indigenous soundscapes to the film, and went on to compose two songs for the soundtrack of The Scarlet Letter.\\nAfter the release of Yonnondio, Buffett signed with Epic Records. In 1994, he released his soundtrack for the CBS miniseries 500 Nations, which was produced by Kevin Costner.\\n\\n\\n==== 1996–2005 ====\\nIn 1996, Buffett produced Star of Wonder, a Christmas CD featuring Celtic harpist Kim Robertson and arranger Eric Segnitz. Buffett then signed with Hollywood Records, which released his album Spirit Dance in 1997.\\nIn 1998, he entered the pop music realm with the release of Comet9\\'s \"Like Mercury\" on Milwaukee-based independent label Don\\'t Records, with Buffett producing, writing and playing multi-instrumentalist.  Co-writer and guitarist Tom Nelson and vocalist Susan Zielke completed the studio trio, with Citizen King members D. J. Brooks and Malcolm Michiles guesting on drums and turntables, respectively. The live band added bassist Josh Warner to the lineup.\\nIn 1999, Buffett\\'s score for the documentary Wisconsin: An American Portrait won a Chicago / Midwest Emmy Award for Best Soundtrack.Also in 1999, Buffett\\'s Spirit – A Journey in Dance Drums and Song aired on PBS as a highly successful pledge break special. Combining modern and American Indian dancers with Director and Choreographer Wayne Cilento, Spirit went on to tour through the end of 1999.

He was a four-term Republican United States Representative for the state of Nebraska. He was the father of Warren Buffett, the billionaire businessman and investor.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nHoward Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska to Henrietta Duvall Buffett and Ernest P. Buffett, owners of a grocery business. Ernest P. Buffett\\'s parents were second cousins, both having mainly English descent. The Buffet surname (renamed to Buffett) originates in France with a Huguenot weaver, named John Buffett, who became Buffett\\'s first American Buffett ancestor when he immigrated to New York in the late-1600s. Howard Buffett attended public schools and graduated from the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1925. While a student, Buffett was a brother of the Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity. He married Leila Stahl on December 27, 1925. The Buffetts were active members of the Dundee Presbyterian Church. After failing to secure a job in the family grocery business, he started a small stock brokerage firm.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nEntering the investment business, Buffett also served on the Omaha board of education from 1939 to 1942. In 1942 he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nebraska district in which Omaha was located. In that election, Buffett was seen as \"a Republican sacrificial lamb in Nebraska\\'s second district when FDR was a popular wartime leader.\" Nevertheless, he went on to win the Republican nomination in the primary and then the subsequent general election.\\nHe was reelected twice. In 1948 he again was the Republican nominee for another term, but was defeated for reelection; however, he was the Republican nominee for the office again in 1950 and won the office back. In 1952 Buffett decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha, Buffett-Falk & Co., in which he worked until shortly before his death. He also served as the campaign manager for conservative Senator Robert A. Taft in Taft\\'s 1952 presidential campaign.\\nAccording to Warren Buffett biographer Roger Lowenstein:\\'Unshakably ethical, Howard refused offers of junkets and even turned down a part of his pay. During his first term, when congressional salary was raised from $10,000 to $12,500, Howard left the extra money in the Capitol disbursement office, insisting that he had been elected at the lower salary.\\' His wife said he considered only one issue when deciding whether or not to vote for a bill: \\'Will this add to, or subtract from, human liberty?\\'\\n\\n\\n== Political philosophy ==\\nHoward Buffett is remembered for his highly libertarian Old Right stance, having maintained a friendship with Murray Rothbard for a number of years. He \"would invariably draw \\'zero\\' ratings from the Americans for Democratic Action and other leftist groups.\"Buffett was a vocal critic of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. Of the Truman Doctrine, he said: \"Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns.\"  Buffett was also \"one of the major voices in Congress opposed to the Korean adventure,\" and \"was convinced that the United States was largely responsible for the eruption of conflict in Korea; for the rest of his life he tried unsuccessfully to get the Senate Armed Services Committee to declassify the testimony of CIA head Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, which Buffett told [Rothbard] established American responsibility for the Korean outbreak.\" The CIA failed to predict the Marxist invasion of the Republic of Korea in 1950, just as it had failed to predict the Soviet Atomic Bomb the previous year, it was these intelligence failures that Rear Admiral Hillenkoetter testified about.\\nSpeaking on the floor of Congress, he opposed military interventionism:\\n\\nEven if it were desirable, America is not strong enough to police the world by military force.

She was president of the Buffett Foundation, which has contributed millions of dollars to educational groups, medical research, family planning groups and other charities.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nSusan was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and graduated from Omaha Central High School. Her father, William Hertzog Thompson, was a minister, psychologist, dean at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, and one-time campaign manager for Howard Buffett.\\nThough her parents and Warren\\'s knew one another, they met at Northwestern University, via Susan\\'s roommate Roberta Buffett, Warren\\'s sister.\\nSusan and Warren married in 1952 at the Dundee Presbyterian Church in Omaha. They had three children together: Susan (born July 30, 1953), Howard (born December 16, 1954), and Peter (born May 4, 1958).Allegations have been made regarding Susan\\'s conduct during her marriage to Warren. These include claims that in the mistaken belief her husband had cheated on her with his friend, Katharine Graham, she sent Graham a passive-aggressive letter that \"let her date Warren Buffett\", and that she had a relationship with her tennis coach, John McCabe.She occasionally performed hit classics from the early 1970s cabaret singer and, in 1977, had a one-night performance at an Omaha theater. Encouraged by songwriter/musician Neil Sedaka to pursue a singing career, she left her husband and moved to a small apartment in San Francisco with her paramour, John McCabe, in Gramercy Tower on Nob Hill. Later, she moved into a large condominium on Broadway near Scott Street in Pacific Heights with views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. She remained married and on good terms with her husband, vacationing together with him and spending time assisting charitable groups. She performed in New York and released several CDs. According to Roger Lowenstein\\'s 1995 Random House biography, Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, while Warren had encouraged Susan to pursue her career in music, he was heartbroken by her move.In 1978, Susan introduced her husband to Astrid Menks, who moved in with Warren in their Omaha home, and married him after Susan\\'s death.The Buffetts attended public functions as husband and wife though they had not lived together for more than half of their marriage. The Buffetts even signed Christmas cards, Warren, Susan, and Astrid, and were often seen together as a trio.\\n\\n\\n== Oral cancer and death ==\\nIn October 2003, Susan was diagnosed with oral cancer; she underwent surgery, radiation therapy and facial reconstruction. Warren flew out from Omaha to be with her every weekend during her recovery and the couple would later contribute $6 million to five California doctors for the study of oral cancer.  She had recovered enough to attend the annual shareholders\\' meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in May 2004, leading a singalong at the Borsheim\\'s reception.Susan died at the age of 72 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage during the summer of 2004 in Cody, Wyoming. Bono performed \"Forever Young\" and \"All I Want Is You\" at her funeral.  Warren was so grief-stricken that he did not attend.  She left approximately $50 million to her children\\'s charity while each of her children received $10 million and each grandchild received $100,000.  She also left a number of friends and employees substantial sums, including $8 million to John McCabe and $1 million to Ron Parks.

The review commented, \"There’s another paradox the film hints at, too: the qualities that made it challenging for Buffett to deal with people are the very qualities that made him such a brilliant investor.\" The New Yorker observed, \"It’s also about an ability to divorce yourself from emotion, to be rational at a time when other people are acting irrationally, and to be calm when others are fearful.\"The New York Times noted the documentary told Buffett\\'s biography \"in a relatively new way\". The review commented that, though the overall portrayal of the man was positive, it also described Buffett, \"as something of a remarkable human computer, gifted with numbers and less so with interpersonal relationships.\"Money observed the film is, \"Chock full of the traditionalist eccentricities the \\'oracle of Omaha\\' is best known for–like his love of Coca Cola, and the fact that he lives in the same house he bought in 1958 for $31,500\". Money pointed out that the documentary went more in-depth than these specifics about Buffett, and \"reveals a surprising set of facts even Buffett die hards may have missed.\"According to the film critic news aggregation analysis on Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary garnered positive reviews from the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, and a negative review from Entertainment Weekly.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBecoming Warren Buffett at IMDb', metadata={'title': 'Becoming Warren Buffett', 'summary': 'Becoming Warren Buffett is a 2017 documentary film about Warren Buffett and his life.

She was the daughter of Leila (Stahl) and U.S. politician and stockbroker Howard Homan Buffett. Doris Buffett intended to give all of her money away before she died.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nBuffett was the granddaughter of Ernest Buffett, who operated a family grocery store in Omaha, Nebraska. Her father Howard Homan Buffett founded the Omaha based investment business Buffett-Falk & Company in 1931. She was the oldest sister of Warren Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, and the third-wealthiest person in the world. Buffett grew up in Kansas, suffered through the Great Depression and saw frugal times as a young wife before her inheritance which eventually allowed her to do philanthropic work. She was married four times and fought two bouts with cancer.\\nBuffett attracted attention with the publication of a 2010 book titled, \"Giving It All Away: The Doris Buffett Story,\" which was authored by Michael Zitz. The book, which she pursued at the urging of her brother Warren Buffett and the lead singer of U2 Bono, describes Doris\\' background and life as a philanthropist. Buffett donated $100 million of her own money, mostly to needy individuals, often taking the time to call and write to them personally and determine the best way to help. Through her Sunshine Lady Foundation she helped thousands of children get an education or attend camp, sponsored young women in Afghanistan and supported prison education programs, amongst other philanthropy work. Her goal was to give away her entire fortune, which remained substantial despite her generosity and the financial crisis of 2007–2008.She established the Letters Foundation alongside her brother Warren Buffett to provide humanitarian grants to people experiencing a crisis through no fault of their own when no other options exist. A hand-up and not hand-out was her philanthropy principle. Her brother Warren Buffett helped fund some of the foundation\\'s early projects though later she began providing funds herself from Berkshire Hathaway stocks she owned.\\nUnlike brother Warren Buffett who grants in \\'wholesale\\', Doris Buffett believed in small and direct grants to people with financial difficulties hence the nickname \\'retail\\' philanthropist. \"She is far more philanthropic than I am. She identifies with the underdog. I do it in a wholesale way, but not on a one-on-one basis. She really wants to know their stories,\" Warren Buffett said to The Wall Street Journal.Doris Buffett also established the Learning By Giving Foundation which promotes the study of experiential philanthropy at colleges and universities across the United States. At the end of the semester, students are given real money to grant to local nonprofits in their community. Doris said the goal of Learning by Giving is to instill in students, \"the urge to do things for others all of their lives; to see the need to do something, to be an activist, to work toward social justice.\" She believed that this program will not only outlive her, but also create a ripple effect that will inspire generations to come.\\nBuffett made her home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and moved to Boston in 2016 to be closer to family, and to receive treatment for Alzheimer\\'s disease.In December 2018, Doris released a second book titled Letters to Doris: One Woman\\'s Quest to Help Those With Nowhere Else to Turn.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nBuffett died on August 4, 2020, at her home in Rockport, Maine, at the age of 92.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nWarren Buffett\\nHoward Buffett\\nPeter Buffett\\nSusan Alice Buffett\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDoris Buffett Legacy website\\nFoundation website\\nBuffett interview', metadata={'title': 'Doris Buffett', 'summary': \"Doris Eleanor Buffett (February 12, 1928 – August 4, 2020) was an American philanthropist also known as the 'retail' philanthropist and the founder of The Sunshine Lady Foundation, The Learning By Giving Foundation, and The Letters Foundation which she co-founded alongside her younger brother, billionaire Warren Buffett.

Chace, who was a carpenter, started working for Samuel Slater, the founder of the first successful textile mill in America. Chace founded his first textile mill in 1806. In 1929, the Valley Falls Company merged with the Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company established in 1889, in Adams, Massachusetts. The combined company was known as Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates.In 1955, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates merged with the Hathaway Manufacturing Company which had been founded in 1888 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, by Horatio Hathaway with profits from whaling and the China Trade. Hathaway had been successful in its first decades, but it suffered during a general decline in the textile industry after World War I. At this time, Hathaway was run by Seabury Stanton, whose investment efforts were rewarded with renewed profitability after the Great Depression. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120 million in revenue, and was headquartered in New Bedford. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the decade, accompanied by large layoffs.\\n\\n\\n=== Transformation into a conglomerate ===\\nIn 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway after noticing it was statistically undervalued. Buffett bought the stock with the idea that as Berkshire closed textile mills and freed capital, there would be a tender offer at some point and they could sell the stock for a profit. Eventually, Buffett acknowledged that the textile business was waning and the company's financial situation was not going to improve. In 1964, Stanton made an oral tender offer to buy back Buffett's stake in the company for $11.50 per share. Buffett agreed to the deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11.375. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry. Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did).

(FMC), and was noted for his friendship with Warren Buffett.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nGottesman was born to a Jewish family in New York City on April 26, 1926.  His father, Benjamin, worked as a banker and investor; his mother, Esther (née Garfunkel), played a key role in procuring the Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel. Through his mother, distant relations included Barrett Visanska, a Polish immigrant and a founder of the Tree of Life Congregation in Columbia, South Carolina, and for whom the Visanska Starks House is named. He had two siblings, Milton Gottesman and Alice Gottesman Bayer. He was also a nephew of American pulp-paper merchant, financier, and philanthropist Samuel Gottesman.  The family relocated to New Rochelle, New York, during Gottesman\\'s childhood.  He joined the US Army after high school and was first sent to Princeton University to study engineering, before being deployed to the South Pacific theater in 1945.  Upon his return from military service after an honorable discharge, he obtained a bachelor\\'s degree from Trinity College.  He then undertook postgraduate studies at Harvard Business School, graduating with a Master of Business Administration in 1950.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nAfter graduating, Gottesman worked at Hallgarten & Company in mergers and acquisitions for around a decade.  In 1963, he was introduced to Warren Buffett at a Wall Street club lunch by a mutual friend, who recognized their identical approach of purchasing value stocks.  They soon became good friends, playing golf with each other and having conversations every Sunday night over the phone about which stocks to invest in.  Over the next two years, Gottesman often made brief trips to visit Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska; they would  discuss ideas from the later part of the day into the early hours of the morning, after which Gottesman would typically return to New York on a red-eye flight to get home by the next morning.In 1964, Gottesman founded the investment advisory firm First Manhattan Co.. He was also an early investor in Berkshire Hathaway.  The two firms co-invested in Diversified Retailing Co., which had been established by Gottesman, Buffett, and Charlie Munger to purchase private retail companies, beginning with Hochschild Kohn\\'s (whose president was the uncle of Gottesman\\'s wife). The trio soon concluded that this acquisition had been a \"terrible mistake,\" and Gottesman oversaw its reselling, at only a minor loss. In 1978, Diversified Retailing merged with Berkshire Hathaway. By March 2021, Gottesman owned 17,202 class A shares and more than two million class B shares in Berkshire Hathaway. This made up a sizable portion of his wealth. Gottesman later commented, \"There probably has never been a better return on any stock held for 44 years in the history of Wall Street\". He estimated that by 2012, they had been worth 6,000 times their original value. In 2003, he joined the Berkshire Hathaway board of directors.\\n\\n\\n== Philanthropy ==\\nIn 2008, Gottesman donated $25 million to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. This gift was used to found the Ruth L. and David S. Gottesman Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, a stem cell research center. He and his wife also funded the Train Track Park\\'s bicycle path around Jerusalem.  The Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth at the American Museum of Natural History is named in their honor. The new building of the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem is also named after them.\\nAfter Gottesman\\'s death, his wife Ruth donated an additional $1 billion to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in February 2024, dedicated to making tuition free for all future medical students.

He was vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett. Buffett described Munger as his closest partner and right-hand man, and credited him with being the \"architect\" of modern Berkshire Hathaway\\'s business philosophy.In addition to his role at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a founding partner of Munger, Tolles & Olson; chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation from 1984 through 2011; chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation, based in Los Angeles, California; and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nCharles Thomas Munger was born on January 1, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Florence \"Toody\" (Russell) and Alfred Case Munger, a lawyer.  As a teenager, he worked at Buffett & Son, a grocery store owned by Warren Buffett\\'s grandfather, Ernest P. Buffett. His grandfather, Thomas Charles Munger, was a state representative and later a U.S. district court judge appointed by Theodore Roosevelt.He enrolled in the University of Michigan, where he studied mathematics. During his time in college, he joined the fraternity Sigma Phi Society. In early 1943, a few days after his 19th birthday, he dropped out of college to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he became a second lieutenant. After receiving a high score on the Army General Classification Test, he was ordered to study meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, California, the town he was to make his home.Through the G.I. Bill Munger took a number of advanced courses through several universities. When he applied to his father\\'s alma mater, Harvard Law School, the dean of admissions rejected him because Munger had not completed an undergraduate degree. However, the dean relented after a call from Roscoe Pound, the former dean of Harvard Law and a Munger family friend. Munger excelled in law school, becoming a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and graduating in 1948 with a J.D., magna cum laude.In college and the Army, he developed \"an important skill\": card playing. He used this in his approach to business. \"What you have to learn is to fold early when the odds are against you, or if you have a big edge, back it heavily because you don\\'t get a big edge often. Opportunity comes, but it doesn\\'t come often, so seize it when it does come.\" He also used the card analogy to explain his approach to investing. He maintained that treating the shares of a company like baseball cards is a losing strategy because it requires one to predict the behavior of often irrational and emotional human beings.\\n\\n\\n== Investment career ==\\nMunger moved with his family to California, where he joined the law firm Wright & Garrett (later Musick, Peeler & Garrett). In 1962, he founded and worked as a real estate attorney at Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. He then gave up the practice of law to concentrate on managing investments and later partnered with Otis Booth in real estate development. When he met Buffett over lunch at the Omaha Club, the two began talking about investments and never stopped. He then partnered with Jack Wheeler to form Wheeler, Munger, and Company, an investment firm with a seat on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. He wound up Wheeler, Munger, and Co. in 1976, after losses of 32% in 1973 and 31% in 1974.Although Munger was better known for his association with Buffett, he ran an investment partnership of his own from 1962 to 1975. According to Buffett\\'s essay \"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\", published in 1984, Munger\\'s investment partnership generated compound annual returns of 19.8% during the 1962–75 period compared to a 5.0% annual appreciation rate for the Dow.Munger was previously the chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.

       " Document(page_content='The World\\'s Billionaires is an annual ranking of people who are billionaires, i.e., they are considered to have a net worth of US$1 billion or more, by the American business magazine Forbes. The list was first published in March 1987. The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt and other factors. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists. This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding any ranking of those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.In 2018, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was ranked at the top for the first time and became the first centibillionaire included in the ranking, surpassing Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who had topped the list 18 of the previous 24 years. In 2022, after topping the list for four years, Bezos was surpassed by Elon Musk. In 2023, Musk was in turn surpassed by French businessman Bernard Arnault, after topping the list for just a year. Arnault became the first French person to top the list.\\n\\n\\n== Methodology ==\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world\\'s wealthiest individuals and sometimes groups or families – who share wealth. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses – some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions. Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets – land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc. – are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual\\'s holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios.

       " Document(page_content='The Buffett indicator (or the Buffett metric, or the Market capitalization-to-GDP ratio) is a valuation multiple used to assess how expensive or cheap the aggregate stock market is at a given point in time.  It was proposed as a metric by investor Warren Buffett in 2001, who called it \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment\", and its modern form compares the capitalization of the US Wilshire 5000 index to US GDP.  It is widely followed by the financial media as a valuation measure for the US market in both its absolute, and de-trended forms.The indicator set an all-time high during the so-called \"everything bubble\", crossing the 200% level in February 2021; a level that Buffett warned if crossed, was \"playing with fire\".\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nOn 10 December 2001, Buffett proposed the metric in a Fortune essay co-authored with journalist Carol Loomis.  In the essay, Buffett presented a chart going back 80 years that showed the value of all \"publicly traded securities\" in the US as a percentage of \"US GNP\".  Buffett said of the metric: \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. And as you can see, nearly two years ago the ratio rose to an unprecedented level. That should have been a very strong warning signal\".Buffett explained that for the annual return of US securities to materially exceed the annual growth of US GNP for a protracted period of time: \"you need to have the line go straight off the top of the chart. That won\\'t happen\".  Buffett finished the essay by outlining the levels he believed the metric showed favorable or poor times to invest: \"For me, the message of that chart is this: If the percentage relationship falls to the 70% or 80% area, buying stocks is likely to work very well for you. If the ratio approaches 200%–as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000–you are playing with fire\".Buffett\\'s metric became known as the \"Buffett Indicator\", and has continued to receive widespread attention in the financial media, and in modern finance textbooks.In 2018, finance author Mark Hulbert writing in the Wall Street Journal, listed the Buffett indicator as one of his \"Eight Best Predictors of the Long-Term Market\".A study by two European academics published in May, 2022 found the Buffett Indicator \"explains a large fraction of ten-year return variation for the majority of countries outside the United States\". The study examined 10-year periods in fourteen developed markets, in most cases with data starting in 1973. The Buffett Indicator forecasted an average of 83% of returns across all nations and periods, though the predictive value ranged from a low of 42% to as high as 93% depending on the specific nation. Accuracy was lower in nations with smaller stock markets.\\n\\n\\n== Theory ==\\nBuffett acknowledged that his metric was a simple one and thus had \"limitations\", however the underlying theoretical basis for the indicator, particularly in the US, is considered reasonable.For example, studies have shown a consistent and strong annual correlation between US GDP growth, and US corporate profit growth, and which has increased materially since the Great Recession of 2007–2009. GDP captures effects where a given industry\\'s margins increase materially for a period, but the effect of reduced wages and costs, dampening margins in other industries.The same studies show a poor annual correlation between US GDP growth and US equity returns, underlining Buffett\\'s belief that when equity prices get ahead of corporate profits (via the GNP/GDP proxy), poor returns will follow.  The indicator has also been advocated for its ability to reduce the effects of \"aggressive accounting\" or \"adjusted profits\", that distort the value of corporate profits in the price–earnings ratio or EV/EBITDA ratio metrics; and that it is not affected by share buybacks (which don\\'t affect aggregate corporate profits).The Buffett indicator has been calculated for most international stock', metadata={'title': 'Buffett indicator', 'summary': 'The Buffett indicator (or the Buffett metric, or the Market capitalization-to-GDP ratio) is a valuation multiple used to assess how expensive or cheap the aggregate stock market is at a given point in time.

When this method was unsuccessful, he turned to a strategy similar to value investing. In 2017, Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments wrote:\\n\\nInstead of using big-picture economics, Keynes increasingly focused on a small number of companies that he knew very well. Rather than chasing momentum, he bought undervalued stocks with generous dividends. [...] Most were small and midsize companies in dull or out of favor industries, such as mining and autos in the midst of the Great Depression. Despite his rough start [by timing markets], Keynes beat the market averages by 6 percent a year over more than two decades.Keynes used similar terms and concepts as Graham and Dodd (e.g. an emphasis on the intrinsic value of equities). A review of his archives at King\\'s College found no evidence of contact between Keynes and his American counterparts and is believed to have developed his investing theories independently. He did not teach his concepts in classes or seminars, unlike Graham and Dodd. The details of his investing theories became widely known decades after his death in 1946. There was \"considerable overlap\" of Keynes\\'s ideas with those of Graham and Dodd. However, their ideas were not entirely congruent.\\n\\n\\n=== Benjamin Graham ===\\nValue investing was established by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. Both were professors at Columbia Business School. In Graham\\'s book The Intelligent Investor, he advocated the concept of margin of safety. The concept was introduced in the book Security Analysis which he co-authored with David Dodd in 1934 and calls for an approach to investing that is focused on purchasing equities at prices less than their intrinsic values. In terms of picking or screening stocks, he recommended purchasing firms which have steady profits, are trading at low prices to book value, have low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and which have relatively low debt.\\n\\n\\n=== Further evolution ===\\nHowever, the concept of value (as well as \"book value\") has evolved significantly since the 1970s.

It tied with Roger Zelazny\\'s This Immortal for the Hugo Award for Best Novel and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966. It is the first installment of the Dune Chronicles. It is one of the world\\'s best-selling science fiction novels of all time.Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.  It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or \"spice\", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.\\nHerbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert\\'s death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.\\nAdaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to mostly negative responses from critics and failure at the box office, although it later developed a cult following. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert\\'s Dune and its 2003 sequel, Frank Herbert\\'s Children of Dune (the latter of which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune).
