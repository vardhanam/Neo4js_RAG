'''''Dune''''' is a 1965 [[Epic (genre)|epic]] [[science fiction]] novel by American author [[Frank Herbert]], originally published as two separate serials (1963-64 novel 'Dune World' and 1965 novel 'Prophet of Dune') in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' magazine. It tied with [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[This Immortal]]'' for the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] and won the inaugural [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1966. It is the first installment of the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune Chronicles'']]. It is one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels of all time.&lt;ref name="RIF"/&gt;&lt;!-- Inaccuracy is acceptable in the Critical reception section. See TALK. --&gt;

''Dune'' is set in the distant future in a [[Feudalism|feudal]] interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary [[fief]]s.  It tells the story of young [[Paul Atreides]], whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet [[Arrakis]]. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]], or "spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.

Herbert wrote five [[sequel]]s: ''[[Dune Messiah]]'', ''[[Children of Dune]]'', ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'', ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', and ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]''. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son [[Brian Herbert]] and author [[Kevin J. Anderson]] continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.

Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] attempted to make [[Dune (Jodorowsky film)|a film]] based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a [[Dune (1984 film)|film adaptation]] directed by [[David Lynch]] was released to mostly negative responses from critics and failure at the box office, although it later developed a [[cult following]]. The book was also adapted into the 2000 [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] miniseries ''[[Frank Herbert's Dune]]'' and its 2003 sequel, ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'' (the latter of which combines the events of ''Dune Messiah'' and ''Children of Dune''). A second [[Dune (2021 film)|film adaptation]], directed by [[Denis Villeneuve]], was released on October 21, 2021, to positive reviews. It grossed $434 million worldwide and went on to be nominated for ten [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], ultimately winning six. Villeneuve's film covers roughly the first half of the original novel; a [[Dune: Part Two|sequel]], which covers the second half of the story, was released on March 1, 2024 to critical acclaim. 

The series has also been used as the basis for [[List of games based on Dune|several board, role-playing, and video games]].

Since 2009, the names of planets from the ''Dune'' novels have been adopted for the real-life nomenclature of plains and other features on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

==Origins==
[[File:USA Oregon Dunes.jpg|thumb|235px|The [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area|Oregon Dunes]], near [[Florence, Oregon]], served as an inspiration for the ''Dune'' saga.]]

After his novel ''[[The Dragon in the Sea]]'' was published in 1957, Herbert traveled to [[Florence, Oregon]], at the north end of the [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area|Oregon Dunes]]. Here, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] was attempting to use [[poverty grass (disambiguation)|poverty grasses]] to stabilize the [[dune|sand dunes]]. Herbert claimed in a letter to his literary agent, [[Lurton Blassingame]], that the moving dunes could "swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Road to Dune]]'' (2005), p. 264, letter by Frank Herbert to his agent Lurton Blassingame outlining "They Stopped the Moving Sands."&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert's article on the dunes, "They Stopped the Moving Sands", was never completed (and only published decades later in ''[[The Road to Dune]]''), but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=Timothy|url=https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107740264|title=Frank Herbert|date=1981|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing Company|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert further drew inspiration from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] mentors like "Indian Henry" (as Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a Henry Martin of the [[Hoh tribe]]) and Howard Hansen. Both Martin and Hansen grew up on the [[Quileute]] [[Quileute Indian Reservation|reservation]] near Herbert's hometown. According to historian [[Daniel Immerwahr]], Hansen regularly shared his writing with Herbert. "[[White people|White men]] are eating the earth," Hansen told Herbert in 1958, after sharing a piece on the effect of logging on the Quileute reservation. "They're gonna turn this whole planet into a wasteland, just like [[North Africa]]." The world could become a "big dune," Herbert responded in agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Immerwahr|first=Daniel|title=Heresies of 'Dune'|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/heresies-of-dune/|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=November 19, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert was also interested in the idea of the [[superhero]] [[Mysticism|mystique]] and [[messiah]]s. He believed that [[feudalism]] was a natural condition humans fell into, where some led and others gave up the responsibility of making decisions and just followed orders. He found that desert environments have historically given birth to several major religions with messianic impulses. He decided to join his interests together so he could play religious and ecological ideas against each other. In addition, he was influenced by the story of [[T. E. Lawrence]] and the "messianic overtones" in Lawrence's involvement in the [[Arab Revolt]] during [[World War I]]. In an early version of ''Dune'', the hero was actually very similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was too straightforward and added more layers to his story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=Timothy|url=https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107740264|title=Frank Herbert|date=1981|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing Company|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert drew heavy inspiration also from [[Lesley Blanch]]'s ''The Sabres of Paradise'' (1960), a [[narrative history]] recounting a mid-19th century [[Caucasian War|conflict in the Caucasus]] between rugged caucasian Muslim tribes and the expansive [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="LAR" /&gt; Language used on both sides of that conflict become terms in Herbert's world—''[[chakobsa]]'', a [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] hunting language, becomes a battle language of humans spread across the galaxy; ''kanly'', a word for blood feud in the 19th century Caucasus, represents a feud between Dune's noble Houses; ''sietch'' and ''tabir'' are both words for camp borrowed from [[Ukrainian Cossacks]] (of the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]]).&lt;ref name="LAR" /&gt;

Herbert also borrowed some lines which Blanch stated were Caucasian proverbs. ''"To kill with the point lacked artistry"'', used by Blanch to describe the Caucasus peoples' love of swordsmanship, becomes in Dune ''"Killing with the tip lacks artistry"'', a piece of advice given to a young Paul during his training. ''"Polish comes from the city, wisdom from the hills"'', a Caucasian [[aphorism]], turns into a desert expression: ''"Polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert".&lt;ref name="LAR" /&gt;''

Another significant source of inspiration for ''Dune'' was Herbert's experiences with [[psilocybin]] and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms, according to [[Mycology|mycologist]] [[Paul Stamets]]'s account of meeting Herbert in the 1980s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stamets|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtsTH7ekvVYC&amp;q=mycelium+running|title=Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World|date=2011|publisher=Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale|isbn=978-1-60774-124-4|pages=126–127|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Frank went on to tell me that much of the premise of ''Dune''—the magic [[Melange (fictional drug)|spice]] (spores) that allowed the bending of space ([[Psychedelic experience|tripping]]), the [[Sandworm (Dune)|giant sand worms]] ([[maggot]]s digesting mushrooms), the eyes of the [[Fremen]] (the [[cerulean]] blue of [[Psilocybe|''Psilocybe'' mushrooms]]), the mysticism of the female spiritual warriors, the [[Bene Gesserit]]s (influenced by the tales of [[María Sabina|Maria Sabina]] and the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico)—came from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and his imagination was stimulated through his experiences with the use of [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising. He published a three-part serial ''Dune World'' in the monthly ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', from December 1963 to February 1964. The serial was accompanied by several illustrations that were not published again. After an interval of a year, he published the much slower-paced five-part ''The Prophet of Dune'' in the January–May 1965 issues.&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Dune'', p. 272."...Frank Herbert toyed with the story about a desert world full of hazards and riches. He plotted a short adventure novel, ''Spice Planet'', but he set that outline aside when his concept grew into something much more ambitious."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Dune'', pp. 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt; The first serial became "Book 1: Dune" in the final published ''Dune'' novel, and the second serial was divided into "Book Two: Muad'dib" and "Book Three: The Prophet". The serialized version was expanded, reworked, and submitted to more than twenty publishers, each of whom rejected it. The novel, ''Dune'', was finally accepted and published in August 1965 by [[Chilton Books]], a printing house better known for publishing auto repair manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Herbert |first=Brian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlbSrcGnhRIC&amp;pg=PA194 |title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert |date=2004 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-7653-0647-0 |pages=194, 208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sterling Lanier]], an editor at Chilton, had seen Herbert's manuscript and had urged his company to take a risk in publishing the book. However, the first printing, priced at {{USD|5.95|1965|long=no}}, did not sell well and was poorly received by critics as being atypical of science fiction at the time. Chilton considered the publication of ''Dune'' a write-off and Lanier was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://jalopnik.com/dune-was-originally-published-by-a-car-repair-manual-co-1847940372 | title = Nobody Wanted To Publish Dune Except A Car Repair Manual Company | first = Steve | last = DaSilva | date = October 26, 2021 | access-date = October 27, 2021 | work = [[Jalopnik]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of time, the book gained critical acclaim, and its popularity spread by word-of-mouth to allow Herbert to start working full time on developing the sequels to ''Dune'', elements of which were already written alongside ''Dune''.&lt;ref name="new yorker endures"/&gt;

At first Herbert considered using [[Mars]] as setting for his novel, but eventually decided to use a fictional planet instead. His son Brian said that "Readers would have too many preconceived ideas about that planet, due to the number of stories that had been written about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2021/dune-science-fiction-saga-parallels-real-science-oregons-dunes/|title=How the ''Dune'' science-fiction saga parallels the real science of Oregon's dunes|first=Alan|last=Boyle|date=October 21, 2021|website=[[GeekWire]]|access-date=June 14, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert dedicated his work "to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'—to the dry-land [[Ecology|ecologists]], wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landa |first1=Edward R. |last2=Feller |first2=Christian |title=Soil and Culture |date=2010 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-90-481-2960-7 |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSG84ikYN-wC&amp;pg=PA101 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Duke [[Leto I Atreides|Leto Atreides]] of [[House Atreides]], ruler of the [[ocean planet]] Caladan, is assigned by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam IV]] to serve as fief ruler of the planet [[Arrakis]]. Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable [[desert planet]], it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source of [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]], or the "spice", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. It is also through the consumption of spice that [[Spacing Guild]] Navigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel. Shaddam, jealous of Duke [[Leto I Atreides|Leto Atreides]]'s rising popularity in the Landsraad, sees House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat, so conspires with [[House Harkonnen]], the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of House Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival. Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind, but is compelled to obey the Emperor's orders anyway.

Leto's [[concubinage|concubine]] [[Lady Jessica]] is an acolyte of the [[Bene Gesserit]], an exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and wields seemingly [[superhuman]] physical and mental abilities, such as the ability to control their bodies down to the cellular level, and also decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of their [[breeding program (Dune)|breeding program]], out of love for Leto she bore a son, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]]. From a young age, Paul is trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiers [[Duncan Idaho]] and [[Gurney Halleck]]. [[Thufir Hawat]], the Duke's [[Mentat]] (human computers, able to store vast amounts of data and perform advanced calculations on demand), has instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue. Jessica has also trained her son in Bene Gesserit disciplines.

Paul's prophetic dreams interest Jessica's superior, the [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]]. She subjects Paul to a deadly test. This involves her holding a poisoned needle (the gom jabbar) to his neck, ready to strike should he withdraw his hand from a box which creates extreme pain by nerve induction but causes no physical damage. This is to test Paul's ability to endure the pain so as not to die on the tip of the needle; to confirm that his human strengths can overcome his animal instincts. Paul passes by enduring greater pain than any female who has ever been subjected to the test.

Leto, Jessica, and Paul travel with their household to occupy [[Arrakeen]], the capital on Arrakis formerly held by House Harkonnen. Leto learns of the dangers involved in harvesting the spice, which is protected by giant [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]], and seeks to negotiate with the planet's indigenous [[Fremen]] people, seeing them as a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the Atreides's arrival, Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's ferocious [[Sardaukar]] troops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his personal physician, the [[Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]], who delivers a drugged Leto to the Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] and his twisted Mentat, [[Piter De Vries]]. Yueh, who performed the kidnapping of Leto under duress, arranges for Jessica and Paul to escape into the desert, where they are presumed dead by the Harkonnens. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule, hoping Leto can kill the Baron during their encounter. The Baron narrowly avoids the gas (due to his shield), which kills Leto, De Vries, and the others in the room. The Baron forces Hawat to take over De Vries's position by dosing him with a long-lasting, fatal poison and threatening to withhold the regular antidote doses unless he obeys. While he follows the Baron's orders, Hawat works secretly to undermine the Harkonnens.

Having fled into the desert, Paul is exposed to high concentrations of spice and has visions through which he realizes he has significant powers (as a result of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme). He foresees potential futures in which he lives among the planet's native [[Fremen]] before leading them on a Holy Jihad across the known universe.

It is revealed Jessica is the daughter of Baron Harkonnen, a secret kept from her by the Bene Gesserit. After being captured by Fremen, Paul and Jessica are accepted into the Fremen community of [[Sietch Tabr]], and teach the Fremen the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known as the "[[weirding way]]". Paul proves his manhood by killing a Fremen named Jamis in a ritualistic [[crysknife]] fight and chooses the Fremen name Muad'Dib, while Jessica opts to undergo a ritual to become a Reverend Mother by drinking the poisonous [[Water of Life (Dune)|Water of Life]]. Pregnant with Leto's daughter, she inadvertently causes the unborn child, [[Alia Atreides|Alia]], to become infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover, [[Chani (character)|Chani]], and has a son with her, Leto.

Two years pass and Paul's powerful prescience manifests, which confirms for the Fremen that he is their prophesied [[Mahdi|messiah]], a legend planted by the Bene Gesserit's [[Missionaria Protectiva]]. Paul embraces his father's belief that the Fremen could be a powerful fighting force to take back Arrakis, but also sees that if he does not control them, their [[jihad]] could consume the entire universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both Baron Harkonnen and the Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly destructive raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephew [[Glossu Rabban]] to rule with an iron fist, hoping the contrast with his shrewder nephew [[Feyd-Rautha]] will make the latter popular among the people of Arrakis when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the Baron of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to seize power, sends spies to monitor activity on Arrakis. Hawat uses the opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true plans, putting further strain on their alliance.

Gurney, who survived the Harkonnen coup and became a smuggler, reunites with Paul and Jessica after a Fremen raid on his harvester. Believing Jessica to be the traitor, Gurney threatens to kill her, but is stopped by Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack, and concludes he must increase his prescience by drinking the Water of Life, which is traditionally fatal to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for three weeks after drinking the poison, but when he wakes, he has clairvoyance across time and space: he is the [[Kwisatz Haderach]], the ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.

Paul senses the Emperor and Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major offensive against the Harkonnen troops. The Emperor arrives with the Baron on Arrakis. The Emperor's troops seize a Fremen outpost, killing many including young Leto, while Alia is captured and taken to the Emperor. Under cover of an [[Thunderstorm|electric storm]], which shorts out the Emperor's troops' defensive shields, Paul and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, assault the capital while Alia assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen quickly defeat both the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops.

Paul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever unless Shaddam abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha attempts to stop Paul by challenging him to a ritualistic [[knife fight]], during which he attempts to cheat and kill Paul with a poison spur in his belt. Paul gains the upper hand and kills him. The Emperor reluctantly cedes the throne to Paul and promises his daughter [[Princess Irulan]]'s hand in marriage. As Paul takes control of the Empire, he realizes that while he has achieved his goal, he is no longer able to stop the Fremen jihad, as their belief in him is too powerful to restrain.

==Themes and influences==
The ''Dune'' series is a landmark of [[science fiction]]. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his ''Dune'' universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the "Butlerian Jihad", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity.&lt;ref name="new yorker endures"/&gt; ''Dune'' considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Sci-fi Moviescapes: The Science Behind the Fiction|first=Matt|last=Hanson|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-240-80772-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[John Harrison (director)|John Harrison]], who adapted ''Dune'' for [[Syfy]]'s [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 miniseries]], called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of "the human condition and its moral dilemmas", and said:
{{Blockquote|A lot of people refer to ''Dune'' as science fiction. I never do. I consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition, a story of myth and legend not unlike the ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' or any messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future ... The story is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it. In the 1960s, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out. Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity necessary to all.&lt;ref name="NYT 2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/03/tv/cover-story-future-myths-adrift-in-the-sands-of-time.html?src=pm |title=Cover Story: Future Myths, Adrift in the Sands of Time |first=Marilyn |last=Stasio |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 3, 2000 |access-date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{blockquote|''Dune'' is a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange, the geriatric spice that represents, among other things, the finite resource of oil. The planet Arrakis features immense, ferocious worms that are like dragons of lore, with "great teeth" and a "bellows breath of cinnamon." This resembles the myth described by an unknown English poet in ''[[Beowulf]]'', the compelling tale of a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs, at the edge of the sea. The desert of Frank Herbert's classic novel is a vast ocean of sand, with giant worms diving into the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain of Shai-hulud. Dune tops are like the crests of waves, and there are powerful sandstorms out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis, life is said to emanate from the Maker (Shai-hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all life on Earth is believed to have evolved from our oceans. Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren't so different from systems we know … and the book characters of his imagination are not so different from people familiar to us.&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Setting"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |chapter=Afterword by Brian Herbert |year=1965 |edition=Kindle |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |page=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Each chapter of ''Dune'' begins with an [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] excerpted from the fictional writings of the character Princess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert's complex fictional universe and themes.&lt;ref name="Cinescape 2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&amp;this_cat=Television&amp;action=page&amp;type_id=&amp;cat_id=&amp;obj_id=26343 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316172142/http://www.mania.com/dune-remaking-classic-novel_article_26343.html |archive-date=March 16, 2008 |title=''Dune'': Remaking the Classic Novel |access-date=November 9, 2008 |last=Fritz |first=Steve |date=December 4, 2000 |website=Cinescape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tor 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torforgeblog.com/2014/02/03/quotes-from-the-end-of-the-world/ |title=Quotes from the End of the World |last=Edison |first=David |website=[[Tor.com]] |date=February 3, 2014 |access-date=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sayings"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dunemessiah.com/irulan.shtml |title=Collected Sayings of Princess Irulan |website=DuneMessiah.com |access-date=November 9, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618071057/http://www.dunemessiah.com/irulan.shtml |archive-date=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They act as foreshadowing and invite the reader to keep reading to close the gap between what the epigraph says and what is happening in the main narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Manlove|first=C.

===Middle-Eastern and Islamic references===
Due to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in the [[Arabic language]], as well as the series' "[[Islamic]] [[Subtext|undertones]]" and themes, a [[Middle-Eastern]] influence on Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly.&lt;ref name="7 Beauties"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Seven Beauties of Science Fiction |first=Istvan |last=Csicsery-Ronay, Jr. |publisher=Wesleyan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVYxl5ued-oC&amp;q=The%20seven%20beauties%20of%20science%20fiction%20by%20Istvan%20Csicsery-Ronay%2C%20Jr.%2C%20Istvan%20Csicsery-Ronay%20%28Jr.%29&amp;pg=PA39 |date=November 28, 2008 |isbn=978-0-8195-6889-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bahayeldin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baheyeldin.com/literature/arabic-and-islamic-themes-in-frank-herberts-dune.html |title=Arabic and Islamic themes in Frank Herbert's ''Dune'' |last=Bahayeldin |first=Khalid |date=January 22, 2004 |access-date=July 21, 2009 |publisher=Baheyeldin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zaki|first=Hoda M.|title=Food for Our Grandmothers: Writings by Arab-American and Arab-Canadian Feminists|publisher=South End Press|year=1994|editor-last=Kadi|editor-first=Joanna|chapter=Orientalism in Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ryding|first=Karin|title=Language in Place: Stylistic Perspectives on Landscape, Place and Environment|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2021|editor-last=Virdis|editor-first=Daniela Francesca|chapter=The Arabic of Dune: Language and Landscape|editor-last2=Zurru|editor-first2=Elisabetta|editor-last3=Lahey|editor-first3=Ernestine}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived from {{Lang-ar|شيء خلود|lit=immortal thing|translit=šayʾ ḫulūd}} or {{Lang-ar|شيخ خلود|lit=old man of eternity|translit=šayḫ ḫulūd}}.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from the {{Lang-ar|شادوف‎|translit=šādūf}}, the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] term for a device used to raise water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (from {{Lang-ar|مؤدب|translit=muʾaddib|lit=educator}}), Lisan al-Gaib (from {{lang-ar|لسان الغيب|translit=lisān al-ġayb|lit=voice of the unseen}}) Usul (from {{Lang-ar|أصول|translit=ʾuṣūl|lit=fundamental principles}}), Shari-a (from {{Lang-ar|شريعة|translit=šarīʿa|lit=[[sharia]]; path}}), Shaitan (from {{Lang-ar|شيطان|translit=šayṭān|lit=[[Shaitan]]; devil; fiend}}), and jinn (from {{Lang-ar|جن|translit=ǧinn|lit=[[jinn]]; spirit; demon; mythical being}}).&lt;ref name="7 Beauties" /&gt; It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an "imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references" and has a distinctly [[Bedouin]] aesthetic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides bears many similarities to the historical [[T. E. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://tim.oreilly.com/herbert/ch03.html|title=Frank Herbert|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly|chapter=Chapter 3: From Concept to Fable|access-date=December 27, 2019|via=oreilly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1962 biopic ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' has also been identified as a potential influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Lawrence of Arabia'' Is the Unlikely Prequel to ''Star Wars'', ''Dune'', And All Your Favorite Fantasy Epics |url=https://decider.com/2015/12/03/lawrence-of-arabia-star-wars-dune-sci-fi/ |via=[[Decider.com]] |website=[[New York Post]] |access-date=June 14, 2019 |date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sabres of Paradise'' (1960) has also been identified as a potential influence upon ''Dune'', with its depiction of [[Imam Shamil]] and the Islamic culture of the [[Caucasus]] inspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology of ''Dune''.&lt;ref name="LAR"&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Los Angeles Review of Books]] |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-secret-history-of-dune/#! |first=Will |last=Collins |title=The Secret History of ''Dune'' |date=September 16, 2017 |access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by the environments of the [[Middle East]]. Similarly Arrakis as a bioregion is presented as a particular kind of political site.

The fictionalized version of the "Kitab al-ibar" in ''Dune'' is a combination of a Fremen religious manual and a desert survival book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hammond|first=Joseph|date=October 18, 2021|title=''Dune'' novels draw on Islamic motifs and have in turn inspired Muslim artists|language=en-US|work=Religion News Service|url=https://religionnews.com/2021/10/18/dune-novels-draw-on-islamic-motifs-and-have-in-turn-inspired-muslim-artists/|access-date=October 31, 2021|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Determann|first=Jörg Matthias|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k1_xDwAAQBAJ|title=Islam, science fiction and extraterrestrial life : the culture of astrobiology in the Muslim world|date=2021|isbn=978-0-7556-0130-1|location=London|pages=97|oclc=1197808773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Additional language and historic influences ====
In addition to Arabic, ''Dune'' derives words and names from a variety of other languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Latin]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ("''Landsraad''"), [[Chakobsa]], the [[Nahuatl]] language of the [[Aztecs]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sanskrit]] ("prana bindu", "prajna"), [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Old English]].&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Language"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Frank|title=Dune|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1965|edition=Kindle|page=878|chapter=Afterword by Brian Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bene Gesserit'' is simply the Latin for "It will have been well fought", also carrying the sense of "It will have been well managed", which stands as a statement of the order's goal and as a pledge of faithfulness to that goal.  Critics tend to miss the literal meaning of the phrase, some positing that the term is derived from the Latin meaning "it will have been well borne", an interpretation which is not well supported by their doctrine in the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tim O'Reilly - Frank Herbert: Chapter 3: From Concept to Fable - O'Reilly Media|url=https://www.oreilly.com/tim/herbert/ch03.html|access-date=2021-11-07|website=www.oreilly.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the inspiration from ''The Sabres of Paradise'', there are also allusions to the tsarist-era [[Russian nobility]] and [[Cossacks]].&lt;ref name="LAR2"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Collins|first=Will|date=September 16, 2017|title=The Secret History of ''Dune''|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-secret-history-of-dune/#!|magazine=[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]|access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families in ''Dune'' was "[[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[bureaucracy]]" which he saw as analogous to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tim O'Reilly - Frank Herbert: Chapter 5: Rogue Gods - O'Reilly Media|url=https://www.oreilly.com/tim/herbert/ch05.html|access-date=2021-11-07|website=www.oreilly.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/5IfgBX1EW00 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170210174612/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IfgBX1EW00&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{Cite web|last=Herbert|first=Frank|date=1985-04-17|title=Frank Herbert speaking at UCLA 4/17/1985|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IfgBX1EW00|website=YouTube|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles Comm Studies}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentalism and ecology===
''Dune'' has been called the "first planetary [[ecology]] novel on a grand scale".&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Edward |author2=Farah Mendlesohn |title=The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00jame_241 |url-access=limited |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2003 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00jame_241/page/n212 183]–184 |isbn=978-0-521-01657-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert hoped it would be seen as an "[[Environmentalism|environmental awareness]] handbook" and said the title was meant to "echo the sound of 'doom'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Herbert|first=Frank|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15636296|title=The maker of Dune : insights of a master of science fiction|date=1987|publisher=Berkley Books|others=Tim O'Reilly|isbn=978-0-425-09785-4|edition=|location=New York|pages=249|oclc=15636296}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reviewed in the best selling countercultural [[Whole Earth Catalog]] in 1968 as a "rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brand|first=Stewart|title=Whole Earth Catalog|year=1968|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. ''Dune'' responded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life-forms adapted to live with limited water. ''Dune'' was followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such as ''[[A Door into Ocean]]'' (1986) and ''[[Red Mars]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="James" /&gt; Environmentalists have pointed out that ''Dune''{{'s}} popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex—almost living—thing, in combination with the [[first images of Earth from space]] being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the international [[Earth Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Robert L.

While the genre of [[climate fiction]] was popularized in the 2010s in response to real global [[climate change]], ''Dune'' as well as other early science fiction works from authors like [[J. G. Ballard]] (''[[The Drowned World]]'') and [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] (the [[Mars trilogy|''Mars'' trilogy]]) have retroactively been considered pioneering examples of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=''Dune'', climate fiction pioneer: The ecological lessons of Frank Herbert's sci-fi masterpiece were ahead of its time|first=Michael|last=Berry|date=August 13, 2015|url=https://www.salon.com/2015/08/13/dune_climate_fiction_pioneer_the_ecological_lessons_of_frank_herberts_sci_fi_masterpiece_were_ahead_of_its_time/|access-date=October 29, 2021|website=[[Salon.com|Salon]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frelik | first = Paweł | title = 'On Not Calling a Spade a Spade': Climate Fiction as Science Fiction | journal = [[American Studies (journal)|American Studies]] | volume =62 | issue  = 1 | date = 2017 | pages = 125–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declining empires===
The Imperium in ''Dune'' contains features of various empires in Europe and the [[Near East]], including the [[Roman Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ower|first=John|date=1974|title=Idea and Imagery in Herbert's ''Dune''|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3828/extr.1974.15.2.129|journal=Extrapolation|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.3828/extr.1974.15.2.129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Kara|date=April 2, 2016|title=Epic World-Building: Names and Cultures in '''Dune''|url=https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107560903|journal=Names: A Journal of Onomastics|volume=64|issue=2|pages=99–108|doi=10.1080/00277738.2016.1159450|s2cid=192897269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rogers|first=Brett M.|title=Brill's Companion to the Reception of Aeschylus|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|year=2018|editor-last=Kennedy|editor-first=Rebecca Futo|chapter='Now Harkonnen Shall Kill Harkonnen': Aeschylus, Dynastic Violence, and Twofold Tragedies in Frank Herbert's ''Dune''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenzo DiTommaso compared ''Dune''{{'s}} portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]],'' which argues that [[Christianity]] allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of [[Ancient Rome]]. In "The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as "parasites". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt and materially indulgent. Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall'' partly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack. The Emperor's Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others.&lt;ref name="DiTommaso"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiTommaso|first=Lorenzo|date=2007|title=The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3828/extr.2007.48.2.5|journal=Extrapolation|volume=48|issue=2|pages=267–291|doi=10.3828/extr.2007.48.2.5|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal by [[Genetic admixture|genetic mixing]] of successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides, described by Frank Herbert as depicting "war as a collective orgasm" (drawing on Norman Walter's 1950 ''The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/1950-walter-thesexualcycleofhumanwarfare.djvu|title=The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare|date=1950|first=Norman|last=Walter|via=gwern.net|access-date=June 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jacurutu.com/viewtopic.php?t=1214#p38497|title=Listening To The Left Hand|first=Frank|last=Herbert |journal=[[Harper's]]|date=December 1973|via=jacurutu.com|access-date=June 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; themes that would reappear in ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]''{{'s}} [[The Scattering (Dune)|Scattering]] and Leto II's all-female [[Fish Speaker]] army.

===Gender dynamics===
[[Gender role|Gender dynamics]] are complex in ''Dune''.   Within the Fremen sietch communities, women have almost full equality.  They carry weapons and travel in raiding parties with men, fighting when necessary alongside the men.  They can take positions of leadership as a Sayyadina or as a Reverend Mother (if she can survive the ritual of ingesting the [[Water of Life (Dune)|Water of Life]].)  Both of these sietch religious leaders are routinely consulted by the all-male Council and can have a decisive voice in all matters of sietch life, security and internal politics.  They are also protected by the entire community.  Due to the high mortality rate among their men, women outnumber men in most sietches. [[Polygamy]] is common, and sexual relationships are voluntary and consensual; as Stilgar says to Jessica, "women among us are not taken against their will."

In contrast, the Imperial aristocracy leaves young women of [[Nobility|noble birth]] very little agency. Frequently trained by the Bene Gesserit, they are raised to eventually marry other aristocrats. Marriages between Major and Minor Houses are political tools to forge alliances or heal old feuds; women are given very little say in the matter. Many such marriages are quietly maneuvered by the Bene Gesserit to produce offspring with some genetic characteristics needed by the sisterhood's human-breeding program. In addition, such highly placed sisters were in a position to subtly influence their husbands' actions in ways that could move the politics of the Imperium toward Bene Gesserit goals.

===Heroism===
{{blockquote|I am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation in it.|Frank Herbert&lt;ref&gt;Herbert liner notes quoted in Touponce p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many [[monomyth|stories describing the birth of a hero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palumbo|first=Donald|date=1998|title=The Monomyth as Fractal Pattern in Frank Herbert's Dune Novels|journal=[[Science Fiction Studies]]|volume=25|pages=433–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.&lt;ref&gt;Tilley, E. Allen. "The Modes of Fiction: A Plot Morphology." ''College English.'' (Feb 1978) 39.6 pp. 692–706.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, Kathryn. "Romance: A Perdurable Pattern." ''College English''. (Oct 1974) 36.2 pp. 129–146.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''Dune'' is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means.&lt;ref&gt;Attebery, Brian. Decoding Gender in Science Fiction. New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 66 {{ISBN|978-0-415-93949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causes the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, "The bottom line of the ''Dune'' trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better  [to] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes."&lt;ref name="Clareson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clareson |first=Thomas |title=Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction: the Formative Period |location=Columbia |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year=1992 |pages=169–172 |isbn=978-0-87249-870-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in 1985, "''Dune'' was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Eye (short story collection)|Eye]] |chapter=Introduction |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-425-08398-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes of ''Dune'' from earlier heroes such as [[Superman]], [[A. E. van Vogt|van Vogt]]'s [[Gilbert Gosseyn]] and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of "painful and slow personal progress." And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through "the application of mystical philosophies and techniques." For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, Ginaz swordsmen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).&lt;ref name="prieto"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Prieto-Pablos | first = Juan A. | title = The Ambivalent Hero of Contemporary Fantasy and Science Fiction | journal = [[Extrapolation (journal)|Extrapolation]] | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–80 | publisher = The University of Texas at Brownsville | date =Spring 1991 | doi = 10.3828/extr.1991.32.1.64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zen and religion===
{{Main|List of Dune religions}}

Early in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced to [[Zen]] by two [[Jungian]] psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who "gave a crucial boost to his thinking".&lt;ref name="O'Reilly C2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://tim.oreilly.com/herbert/ch02.html|title=Frank Herbert|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly|chapter=Chapter 2: Under Pressure|access-date=March 26, 2019|via=oreilly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zen teachings ultimately had "a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert's] work".&lt;ref name="O'Reilly C2"/&gt; Throughout the ''Dune'' series and particularly in ''Dune'', Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="O'Reilly C2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unpublished interview with Frank Herbert and Professor Willis E.

{{blockquote|What especially pleases me is to see the interwoven themes, the fugue like relationships of images that exactly replay the way ''Dune'' took shape. As in an [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] lithograph, I involved myself with recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul's gift of prescience - the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] fixation? For the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] to perform, it must tangle itself in a web of [[predestination]]. Yet predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It's like a [[koan]], a Zen mind breaker. It's like the [[Crete|Cretan]] [[Epimenides]] saying, "All Cretans are liars."&lt;ref name="Genesis"/&gt;}}

Brian Herbert called the ''Dune'' universe "a spiritual melting pot", noting that his father incorporated elements of a variety of religions, including [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism|Sufi mysticism]] and other Islamic belief systems, [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Religion"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |chapter=Afterword by Brian Herbert |year=1965 |edition=Kindle |publisher=Penguin Group |page=873}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that Frank Herbert's fictional future in which "religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms" represents the author's solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claimed to have "the one and only revelation."&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Religion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=During my studies of deserts, of course, and previous studies of religions, we all know that many religions began in a desert atmosphere, so I decided to put the two together because I don't think that any one story should have any one thread.

===Asimov's ''Foundation''===
Tim O'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wrote ''Dune'' as a counterpoint to [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]]. In his [[monograph]] on Frank Herbert, O'Reilly wrote that "''Dune'' is clearly a commentary on the ''Foundation'' trilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced into ''Dune'' is that [[List of Foundation series characters#The Mule|the Mule]], not the Foundation, is his hero."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.oreilly.com/tim/herbert/ch05.html|title=Frank Herbert|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly|chapter=Chapter 5: Rogue Gods|access-date=May 15, 2020|via=oreilly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to O'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical science.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In contrast to the ''Foundation'' series and its praise of science and rationality, ''Dune'' proposes that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Both Herbert and Asimov explore the implications of prescience (i.e., visions of the future) both psychologically and socially. The ''Foundation'' series deploys a broadly determinist approach to prescient vision rooted in mathematical reasoning on a macroscopic social level. ''Dune'', by contrast, invents a biologically rooted power of prescience that becomes determinist when the user actively relies on it to navigate past an undefined threshold of detail. Herbert's eugenically produced and spice-enhanced prescience is also personalized to individual actors whose roles in later books constrain each other's visions, rendering the future more or less mutable as time progresses. In what might be a comment on ''Foundation'', Herbert's most powerfully prescient being in ''God Emperor of Dune'' laments the boredom engendered by prescience, and values surprises, especially regarding one's death, as a  psychological necessity.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

[T]ruly effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning statesmen and seeresses all bend before this new Messiah". Budrys faulted in particular Herbert's decision to kill Paul's infant son offstage, with no apparent emotional impact, saying "you cannot be so busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek".&lt;ref name="budrys196604"&gt;{{Cite magazine

==Sequels and prequels==
{{see also|Dune (franchise)#Development and publication}}
After ''Dune'' proved to be a critical and financial success for Herbert, he was able to devote himself full time to writing additional novels in the series. He had already drafted parts of the second and third while writing ''Dune''.&lt;ref name="new yorker endures"/&gt; The series included ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' (1969), ''[[Children of Dune]]'' (1976), ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' (1981), ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' (1984), and ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'' (1985), each sequentially continuing on the narrative from ''Dune''. Herbert died on February 11, 1986.&lt;ref name="Post-Gazette Obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Frank Herbert, author of sci-fi best sellers, dies |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/pittsburgh-post-gazette-13feb1986-pit/4656607/ |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=February 13, 1986 |access-date=July 27, 2009 |archive-date=February 16, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240216172036/https://www.newspapers.com/article/pittsburgh-post-gazette-13feb1986-pit/4656607/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert's son, [[Brian Herbert]], had found several thousand pages of notes left by his father that outlined ideas for other narratives related to ''Dune''. Brian Herbert enlisted author [[Kevin J. Anderson]] to help build out [[prequel]] novels to the events of ''Dune''. Brian Herbert's and Anderson's [[Dune prequel series|''Dune'' prequels]] first started publication in 1999, and have led to additional stories that take place between those of Frank Herbert's books.&lt;ref name="PW Dune 1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/19971117/35200-pw-bantam-pays-3m-for-dune-prequels-by-herbert-s-son.html |title=Bantam Pays $3M for ''Dune'' Prequels by Herbert's Son |date=November 17, 1997 |first=Judy |last=Quinn |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notes for what would have been ''Dune 7'' also enabled them to publish ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007), sequels to Frank Herbert's final novel ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', which complete the chronological progression of his original series, and wrap up storylines that began in ''Heretics of Dune''.

===Early stalled attempts===
In 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by [[Arthur P. Jacobs]]) optioned the [[film rights|rights to film]] ''Dune''. As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel to ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', ''Dune'' was delayed for another year. Jacobs' first choice for director was [[David Lean]], but he turned down the offer. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also considered to direct. Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued. Initially, the first treatment had been handled by [[Robert Greenhut]], the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequently [[Rospo Pallenberg]] was approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974. However, Jacobs died in 1973.&lt;ref name="Dune: Book to Screen Timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/timeline.asp |title=''Dune'': Book to Screen Timeline |publisher=Duneinfo.com |access-date=January 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517163719/http://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/timeline.asp |archive-date=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jodorowskys Dune.jpg|thumb|left|310px|Pre-release flyer for Jodorowsky's ''Dune'']]
In December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights from APJ, with [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] set to direct.&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/jodorowsky/ |title=''Dune: Le Film Que Vous Ne Verrez Jamais'' (''Dune'': The Film You Will Never See) |first=Alejandro |last=Jodorowsky |work=[[Métal Hurlant]] |issue=107 |year=1985 |publisher=DuneInfo.com |access-date=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Jodorowsky planned to film the story as a 14-hour feature, set to star his own son [[Brontis Jodorowsky]] in the lead role of Paul Atreides, [[Salvador Dalí]] as [[Shaddam IV]], Padishah Emperor, [[Amanda Lear]] as [[Princess Irulan]], [[Orson Welles]] as [[Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]], [[Gloria Swanson]] as [[Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], [[David Carradine]] as [[Duke Leto Atreides]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as [[Lady Jessica]], [[Alain Delon]] as [[Duncan Idaho]], [[Hervé Villechaize]] as [[Gurney Halleck]], [[Udo Kier]] as Piter De Vries, and [[Mick Jagger]] as [[Feyd-Rautha]]. It was at first proposed to score the film with original music by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Henry Cow]], and [[Magma (band)|Magma]]; later on, the soundtrack was to be provided by [[Pink Floyd]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Cutler, book included with Henry Cow 40th Anniversary CD box set (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting of [[Chris Foss]], a British artist who designed covers for science fiction periodicals, [[Jean Giraud|Jean Giraud (Moebius)]], a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for ''[[Metal Hurlant]]'' magazine, and [[H. R. Giger]].&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"/&gt; Moebius began designing creatures and characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to design the film's space ships and hardware.&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"/&gt; Giger began designing the Harkonnen Castle based on Moebius's [[storyboard]]s. [[Dan O'Bannon]] was to head the special effects department.&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"/&gt;

Dalí was cast as the Emperor.&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"/&gt; Dalí later demanded to be paid $100,000 per hour; Jodorowsky agreed, but tailored Dalí's part to be filmed in one hour, drafting plans for other scenes of the emperor to use a mechanical mannequin as substitute for Dalí.&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"/&gt; According to Giger, Dalí was "later invited to leave the film because of his pro-[[Francisco Franco|Franco]] statements".&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Gaby (ed). ''HR GIGER Arh+''. Taschen, 2001, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the storyboards, designs, and script were finished, the financial backing dried up. Frank Herbert traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour movie ("It was the size of a phone book", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. Jodorowsky said in 1985 that he found the ''Dune'' story mythical and had intended to re-create it rather than adapt the novel; though he had an "enthusiastic admiration" for Herbert, Jodorowsky said he had done everything possible to distance the author and his input from the project.&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"/&gt; Although Jodorowsky was embittered by the experience, he said the ''Dune'' project changed his life, and some of the ideas were used in his and Moebius's ''[[The Incal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kalder|first=Daniel|date=January 25, 2011|title=Alejandro Jodorowsky's dance on the edge of meaning|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jan/25/alejandro-jodorowsky|access-date=July 28, 2020|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Bannon entered a psychiatric hospital after the production failed, then worked on 13 scripts, the last of which became ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"/&gt; A 2013 documentary, ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]'', was made about Jodorowsky's failed attempt at an adaptation.

In 1976, [[Dino De Laurentiis]] acquired the rights from Gibon's consortium. De Laurentiis commissioned Herbert to write a new screenplay in 1978; the script Herbert turned in was 175 pages long, the equivalent of nearly three hours of screen time. De Laurentiis then hired director [[Ridley Scott]] in 1979, with [[Rudy Wurlitzer]] writing the screenplay and H. R. Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production; Scott and Giger had also just worked together on the film ''Alien'', after O'Bannon recommended the artist.&lt;ref name="visualists"&gt;"The Visualists: Direction and Design", ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McIntee |first=David |author-link=David A.

He worked on three drafts of the script, using ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'' as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science fiction film, ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). As he recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But after seven months I dropped out of ''Dune'', by then Rudy Wurlitzer had come up with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent distillation of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised ''Dune'' was going to take a lot more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the ''Dune'' script was his.
:—From ''Ridley Scott: The Making of his Movies'' by Paul M. Sammon&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1984 film by David Lynch===
{{main|Dune (1984 film)}}
In 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the ''Dune'' sequels (written and unwritten). After seeing ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', De Laurentiis' daughter [[Raffaella De Laurentiis|Raffaella]] decided that [[David Lynch]] should direct the movie. Around that time Lynch received several other directing offers, including ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. He agreed to direct ''Dune'' and write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cinefantastique]]'', September 1984 (Vol 14, No 4 &amp; 5 – Double issue).&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch worked on the script for six months with [[Eric Bergren]] and Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts. Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/movies/the-world-of-dune-is-filmed-in-mexico.html | title = The World Of 'Dune' Is Filmed In Mexico | first = Aljean | last = Harmetz | date = September 4, 1983 | access-date = October 31, 2021 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour long film, but at demands from [[Universal Pictures]], the film's distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage.&lt;ref name="gizmodo lynch alan smithee"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://gizmodo.com/the-story-of-dune-david-lynch-and-hollywoods-most-not-1843885321 | title = The Story of Dune, David Lynch, and Hollywood's Most Notorious Pseudonym | first = Eleanor | last= Fye | date=  June 8, 2020 | access-date = October 31, 2021 | work = [[Gizmodo]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[Dune (1984 film)|first film]] of ''Dune'', directed by Lynch, was released in 1984, nearly 20 years after the book's publication. Though Herbert said the book's depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he was pleased with the film, saying that "They've got it. It begins as ''Dune'' does. And I hear my dialogue all the way through. There are some interpretations and liberties, but you're gonna come out knowing you've seen ''Dune''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088153,00.html |last=Rozen |first=Leah |title=With Another Best-Seller and An Upcoming Film, ''Dune'' Is Busting Out All Over For Frank Herbert|date=June 25, 1984 |website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|volume=21|issue=25|pages=129–130|access-date=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the film were negative, saying that it was incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book's plot.&lt;ref name="Screen"&gt;Feeney, Mark.

Lynch was extremely displeased with this move, and demanded that Universal replace his name on these cuts with the pseudonym "[[Alan Smithee]]", and has generally distanced himself from the film since.&lt;ref name="gizmodo lynch alan smithee"/&gt;

{{main|Frank Herbert's Dune}}
In 2000, [[John Harrison (filmmaker)|John Harrison]] adapted the novel into ''[[Frank Herbert's Dune]]'', a [[miniseries]] that premiered on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]].&lt;ref name="NYT 2000"/&gt; As of 2004, the miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070703213605/http://www.digitalwebbing.com/interviews/042104_anderson.html Kevin J.

'''Franklin Patrick Herbert Jr.''' (October 8, 1920{{Snd}}February 11, 1986) was an American [[science-fiction]] author best known for the 1965 novel [[Dune (novel)| ''Dune'']] and its five sequels. Though&lt;!--Before?--&gt; he became famous for his novels, he also wrote short stories and worked as a newspaper journalist, photographer, book reviewer, ecological consultant, and lecturer.

The [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' saga]], set in the distant future, and taking place over millennia, explores complex themes, such as the long-term survival of the human species, human [[evolution]], [[planetary science]] and ecology, and the intersection of religion, politics, economics and [[power (sociology) |power]] in a future where humanity has long since developed interstellar travel and settled many thousands of worlds. ''Dune'' is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time,&lt;ref name="RIF"&gt;{{cite web|date= March 18, 2003|title= SCI FI Channel Auction to Benefit Reading Is Fundamental|url=http://pnnonline.org/article.php?sid=4302|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005501/http://pnnonline.org/article.php?sid=4302|archive-date=September 28, 2007 |access-date= September 28, 2007|publisher= PNNonline.org ([[Internet Archive]])|quote= Since its debut in 1965, Frank Herbert's ''Dune'' has sold over 12 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling science fiction novel of all time ...

===Education===
He enrolled in high school at Salem High School (now [[North Salem High School (Salem, Oregon)|North Salem High School]]), where he graduated the next year.&lt;ref name="salem" /&gt; In 1939 he lied about his age to get his first newspaper job at the ''Glendale Star''.&lt;ref name="Post-Gazette Obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Frank Herbert, author of sci-fi best sellers, dies |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/pittsburgh-post-gazette-13feb1986-pit/4656607/ |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=February 13, 1986 |access-date=July 27, 2009 |archive-date=February 16, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240216172036/https://www.newspapers.com/article/pittsburgh-post-gazette-13feb1986-pit/4656607/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert then returned to Salem in 1940 where he worked for the ''Oregon Statesman'' newspaper (now ''[[Statesman Journal]]'') in a variety of positions, including photographer.&lt;ref name="salem" /&gt;

Herbert married Flora Lillian Parkinson in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[California]], in 1941. They had one daughter, Penelope (b. February 16, 1942), and divorced in 1943.&lt;ref name="flpdivorce"&gt;Oregon Center For Health Statistics; Portland, Oregon, US; ''Oregon, Divorce Records, 1925–1945''; Document no. 30939&lt;/ref&gt; During 1942, after the U.S. entry into [[World War II]], he served in the Navy's [[Seabees]] for six months as a photographer, but suffered a head injury and was given a medical discharge. Herbert subsequently moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] where he reported for ''[[The Oregon Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historylink.org/File/21248|work=[[HistoryLink]]|title=Herbert, Frank Patrick (1920–1986)|last=Beck|first=Katherine|date=June 9, 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210904204522/https://www.historylink.org/File/21248|archive-date=September 4, 2021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Herbert attended the [[University of Washington]], where he met Beverly Ann Stuart at a creative writing class in 1946. They were the only students who had sold any work for publication; Herbert had sold two [[pulp magazine|pulp]] adventure stories to magazines, the first to ''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]'' in 1945, and Stuart had sold a story to ''Modern Romance'' magazine. They married in Seattle in 1946, and had two sons, [[Brian Herbert|Brian]] (b. 1947) and Bruce (1951–1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marin County: Newspaper Obituaries of AIDS Victims (1984–1994)|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/marin/aids/aidsobits.htm|access-date=March 26, 2011|work=[[Marin Independent Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024150121/http://www.sfgenealogy.com/marin/aids/aidsobits.htm|archive-date=October 24, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 Herbert and his wife moved to California to work on the Santa Rosa ''[[Press-Democrat]]''. Here they befriended the psychologists Ralph and Irene Slattery. The Slatterys introduced Herbert to the work of several thinkers who would influence his writing, including [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]; they also familiarized Herbert with [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irene Slattery had been a former student of Jung's in Zurich. See [[#CITEREFTouponce1988|Touponce 1988, pp. 9–10]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert never graduated from college. According to his son Brian, he wanted to study only what interested him and so did not complete the required curriculum. He returned to journalism and worked at the ''[[Seattle Star]]'' and the ''[[Oregon Statesman]]''. He was a writer and editor for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''{{'s}} ''California Living'' magazine for a decade.

===Early career===
In a 1973 interview, Herbert stated that he had been reading science fiction "about ten years" before he began writing in the genre, and he listed his favorite authors as [[H. G. Wells]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Poul Anderson]] and [[Jack Vance]].&lt;ref name="vertex"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Turner |first=Paul |date=October 1973 |title=''Vertex Magazine'' Interview |url=http://members.multimania.co.uk/Fenrir/ctdinterviews.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021031705/http://members.multimania.co.uk/Fenrir/ctdinterviews.htm |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |magazine=Vertex Magazine |volume=1 |issue=4 |access-date=October 21, 2012 |quote=Well, I did read some Heinlein.

I read Poul Anderson.  |via="The Prelude to Dune Trilogy" at members.multimania.co.uk/Fenrir/ctdinterviews.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert's first science fiction story, "Looking for Something", was published in the April 1952 issue of ''[[Startling Stories]]'', then a monthly edited by Samuel Mines.

During this time Herbert also worked as a [[speechwriter]] for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] senator [[Guy Cordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Linda L.|title=The Sons of Dune|url=http://www.januarymagazine.com/profiles/duneprofile.html|access-date=August 31, 2014|work=January Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Dune'' ===
[[File:USA Oregon Dunes.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area|Oregon Dunes]] near [[Florence, Oregon]], served as an inspiration for the ''Dune'' saga.]]
Herbert began researching ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' in 1959. He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] during the 1960s. The novel ''Dune'' was published in 1965, which spearheaded the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' franchise]]. He later told [[Willis E. McNelly]] that the novel originated when he was assigned to write a magazine article about sand dunes in the [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area|Oregon Dunes]] near [[Florence, Oregon]]. He got overinvolved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but it planted the seed that led to ''Dune''. Another significant source of inspiration for ''Dune'' was Herbert's experiences with [[psilocybin]] and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms, according to [[Mycology|mycologist]] [[Paul Stamets]]'s account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stamets|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtsTH7ekvVYC&amp;q=mycelium+running|title=Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World|date= 2011|publisher=Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale|isbn=978-1-60774-124-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biography of Frank Herbert, ''Dreamer of Dune'', written by the son Brian confirms that the author was passionate about mushrooms, but doesn't confim Frank's use of psilocibyn mushrooms.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;

''Dune'' took six years of research and writing to complete and was much longer than other commercial science fiction of the time. ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' (the renamed ''Astounding'', still edited by [[John W. Campbell]]) published it in two parts comprising eight installments, "Dune World" from December 1963 and "Prophet of Dune" in 1965.&lt;ref name="isfdb" /&gt; It was then rejected by nearly twenty book publishers. One editor prophetically wrote, "I might be making the mistake of the decade, but..."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|date=October 28, 2008|title=BBC – h2g2|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-london/A42130199|access-date=May 26, 2014|website=Edited guide entry, Frank Patrick Herbert, Jr. – Author|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sterling E. Lanier]], an editor of [[Chilton Publishing Company|Chilton Book Company]] (known mainly for its auto-repair manuals), had read the Dune serials and offered a $7,500 advance plus future royalties for the rights to publish them as a hardcover book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandworms of Dune Blog|url=http://www.frankherbert.org/wormsblog/page051.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516124808/http://www.frankherbert.org/wormsblog/page051.html|archive-date=May 16, 2013|access-date=April 27, 2013|publisher=Frankherbert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert rewrote much of his text.&lt;ref name="kirjasto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Liukkonen|first=Petri|title=Frank Herbert|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010107/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm|archive-date=April 27, 2014|website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi)|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dune'' was soon a critical success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It won the [[Nebula Award]] for Best Novel in 1965 and shared the [[Hugo Award]] in 1966 with ''[[...And Call Me Conrad]]'' by [[Roger Zelazny]].&lt;ref name="SFAwards" /&gt;

''Dune'' was not an immediate bestseller. By 1968 Herbert had made $20,000 from it, far more than most science fiction novels of the time were generating, but not enough to let him take up full-time writing. However, the publication of ''Dune'' did open doors for him. He was the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''{{'s}} education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in [[Bachelor of General Studies|general studies]] and [[integrative learning|interdisciplinary studies]] at the University of Washington (1970–1972). He worked in [[Vietnam]] and [[Pakistan]] as a social and ecological consultant in 1972. In 1973 he was director-photographer of the television show ''The Tillers''.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Brian. ''Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert''. New York: Tor Books, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;257–258, {{ISBN|0-765-30646-8}} "[Frank Herbert completed] a half-hour documentary film based upon fieldwork he had done with [[Roy Prosterman]] in Pakistan [and] Vietnam ... Entitled ''The Tillers'', it was written, filmed and directed by Frank Herbert. ... it appeared on King Television in Seattle and on the Public Broadcasting System."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|I don't worry about inspiration or anything like that.... later, coming back and reading what I have produced, I am unable to detect the difference between what came easily and when I had to sit down and say, "Well, now it's writing time and now I'll write."&lt;ref&gt;
Herbert quoted in Murray, Donald Morison (Editor) ''Shoptalk: learning to write with writers'' (1990) Cook Publishers, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;|Frank Herbert}}

By the end of 1972, Herbert had retired from newspaper writing and became a full-time fiction writer. During the 1970s and 1980s, he enjoyed considerable commercial success as an author. He divided his time between homes in [[Hawaii]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Olympic Peninsula]]; his home in [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]] on the peninsula was intended to be an "ecological demonstration project".{{Sfn|Touponce|1988}}{{Page needed|date=October 2021}} During this time he wrote numerous books and pushed ecological and philosophical ideas. He continued his [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' saga]] with ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' (1969), ''[[Children of Dune]]'' (1976), ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' (1981), ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' (1984) and ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'' (1985). Herbert planned to write a seventh novel to conclude the series, but his death in 1986 left storylines unresolved.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/books/review/Itzkoff.t.html|title=Across the Universe: 'Dune' Babies|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=September 24, 2006|website=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024031606/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/books/review/Itzkoff.t.html|archive-date=October 24, 2015|url-status=live|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works by Herbert include ''[[The Godmakers (novel)|The Godmakers]]'' (1972), ''[[The Dosadi Experiment]]'' (1977), ''[[The White Plague]]'' (1982) and the books he wrote in partnership with [[Bill Ransom]]: ''[[The Jesus Incident]]'' (1979), ''[[The Lazarus Effect (novel)|The Lazarus Effect]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Ascension Factor]]'' (1988), which were sequels to Herbert's 1966 novel ''[[Destination: Void]]''. He also helped launch the career of [[Terry Brooks]] with a very positive review of Brooks' first novel, ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]'', in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Shawn Speakman|title=Website History|url=http://www.terrybrooks.net/bio/website-history/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120914143839/http://www.terrybrooks.net/bio/website-history/|publisher=Terrybrooks.net|access-date=June 22, 2011|archive-date=September 14, 2012|url-status=dead}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Success, family changes, and death ===
Herbert's change in fortune was shadowed by tragedy. In 1974, his wife Beverly underwent treatment for [[lung cancer]]. She lived ten more years, but her health was adversely affected by the treatment.&lt;ref name="chapterhouse"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert, Frank P.|url=https://archive.org/details/chapterhousedune00herb|title=Chapterhouse: Dune|date=1987|publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group, [[Ace Books]]|isbn=0-441-10267-0|location=New York City|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chapterhousedune00herb/page/59 59], 436|quote=It was typical of her that she wanted me to call the radiologist whose treatment in 1974 was the proximate cause of her death and thank him...|url-access=registration|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1978, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention held at the El Rancho Tropicana in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], California.{{cn|date=March 2024}} In 1979, he met anthropologist Jim Funaro with whom he conceived the [[Contact Conference]].{{cn|date=March 2024}} Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984.&lt;ref name="bahdeath"&gt;Washington State Archives; Olympia, Washington; ''Washington Death Index, 1940–1959, 1965–2017''; Certificate no. 090281.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert completed and published ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' that year. In his afterword to 1985's ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Herbert included a dedication to Beverly.

1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of [[David Lynch]]'s film version of ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an [[A-list]] cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States. However, despite a disappointing response in the US, the film was a critical and commercial success in Europe and Japan.&lt;ref name="kirjasto" /&gt;

In 1985, after Beverly's death, Herbert married his former Putnam representative Theresa Shackleford.{{cn|date=March 2024}} The same year he published ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', which tied up many of the saga's story threads. This would be Herbert's final single work (the collection ''[[Eye (short story collection)|Eye]]'' was published that year, and ''Man of Two Worlds'' was published in 1986). He died of a massive [[pulmonary embolism]] while recovering from surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 11, 1986, in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], aged 65.{{sfn|Touponce|1988}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Author of 'Dune' claimed by cancer - UPI Archives |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/02/12/Author-of-Dune-claimed-by-cancer/8008508568400/ |access-date=November 15, 2023 |website=UPI |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of government ===
Herbert was a strong critic of the [[Soviet Union]]. He was a distant relative of the [[Republicanism in the United States|Republican]] senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], whom he referred to as "Cousin Joe". However, he was appalled to learn of McCarthy's blacklisting of suspected communists from working in certain careers and believed that he was endangering essential freedoms of citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbert|first1=Brian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hmg0YFP52XcC&amp;q=frank+herbert+like+mccarthy&amp;pg=PA91|title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert|date=2003|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=978-0765306463|page=91|access-date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert believed that governments lie to protect themselves and that, following the [[Watergate scandal]], President [[Richard Nixon]] had unwittingly taught an important lesson in not trusting government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbert|first1=Brian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3SF08iQGpEC&amp;q=frank+herbert+richard+nixon+provided+proof&amp;pg=PT164|title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert|date=2003|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=978-1429958448|access-date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vasil.ludost.net/dunegenesis.pdf|title=Dune Genesis by Frank Herbert|website=Vasil.ludost.net|access-date=March 1, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert also opposed [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|American involvement in the war in Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;"This was Frank Herbert, speaking from his own heart... It was a philosophy of [[non-violence]] that would ultimately lead to his involvement in the movement to stop the war in Vietnam." Herbert, Brian. (2003). ''Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert''. MacMillan. Retrieved February 13, 2015 (p. 157).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', he wrote:
{{blockquote|All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.

==Ideas and themes==
Frank Herbert used his science fiction novels to explore complex&lt;ref&gt;"With its blend (or sometimes clash) of complex intellectual discourse and Byzantine intrigue, ''Dune'' provided a template for FH's more significant later works. Sequels soon began to appear which carried on the arguments of the original in testingly &lt;!-- ? --&gt; various manners and with an intensity of discourse seldom encountered in the sf field. ''Dune Messiah'' (1969) elaborates the intrigue at the cost of other elements, but ''Children of Dune'' (1976) recaptures much of the strength of the original work and addresses another recurrent theme in FH's work – the evolution of Man, in this case into SUPERMAN;..." "Frank Herbert", ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''.&lt;/ref&gt; ideas involving philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust of his work was a fascination with the question of human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have tried to read everything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a [[cult]],&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Herbert|first=Frank|date=July 1980|title=''Dune'' Genesis|url=http://www.frankherbert.org/news/genesis.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107220342/http://www.frankherbert.org/news/genesis.html|archive-date=January 7, 2012|access-date=February 14, 2014|work=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]|publisher=FrankHerbert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; something he was very much against.

There are a number of key themes in Herbert's work:
* A concern with leadership. He explored the human tendency to slavishly follow charismatic leaders. He delved into both the flaws and potentials of bureaucracy and government.&lt;ref name="gm" /&gt;
* Herbert was among the first science fiction authors to popularize ideas about ecology&lt;ref&gt;McNeilly, Willis E.
"Herbert, Frank (Patrick)" in [[James Gunn (author)|Gunn, James]]. ''The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''.
London, Viking, 1988. (pp. 222–24) {{ISBN|0-670-81041-X}} . "Herbert felt strongly about many
causes, particularly ecology&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems thinking]]. He stressed the need for humans to think both systematically and long-term.&lt;ref&gt;"When I was quite young&amp;nbsp;... I began to suspect there must be flaws in my sense of reality&amp;nbsp;... But I had been produced to focus on objects (things) and not on systems (processes)." Frank Herbert, "Doll Factory, Gun Factory", (1973 Essay), reprinted in ''The Maker of Dune: Thoughts of a Science Fiction Master'' edited by Tim O'Reilly. [[Berkley Books]], 1987, {{ISBN|0425097854}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The relationship between religion, politics and [[power (sociology)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;"Frank Herbert's true stroke of
genius consisted&amp;nbsp;... in inviting a way of thinking about humanity, history, religion, and politics as complex and interdependent as ecosystems themselves". Jeffery Nicholas, ''Dune and Philosophy: Weirding Way of Mentat''. Open Court Publishing, 2011, {{ISBN|0812697154}}, (p.&amp;nbsp;149).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human survival and evolution: Herbert writes of the [[Fremen]], the [[Sardaukar]], and the [[The Dosadi Experiment|Dosadi]], who are molded by their terrible living conditions into dangerous super races.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=July 3, 2015|title=Dune, 50 years on: how a science fiction novel changed the world|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/03/dune-50-years-on-science-fiction-novel-world|access-date=October 27, 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human possibilities and potential: Herbert offered [[Mentat]]s, the [[Bene Gesserit]] and the [[Bene Tleilax]] as different visions of human potential.
* The nature of [[sanity]] and [[Mental illness|madness]]. Frank Herbert was interested in the work of [[Thomas Szasz]] and the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement. Often, Herbert poses the question, "''What is sane?''", and while there are clearly insane behaviors and psychopathies as evinced by characters ([[Piter De Vries]] for instance), it is often suggested that normal and abnormal are relative terms which humans are sometimes ill-equipped to apply to one another, especially on the basis of statistical regularity.&lt;ref name="gm" /&gt;
* The possible effects and consequences of consciousness-altering chemicals, such as [[Melange (fictional drug)|the spice]] in the ''Dune'' saga, as well as the "Jaspers" fungus in ''[[The Santaroga Barrier]]'', and the [[Kelp]] in the [[Destination: Void universe#WorShip novels|Destination: Void]] sequence.&lt;ref name="gm" /&gt;
* How language shapes thought. More specifically, Herbert was influenced by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s ''[[General Semantics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Tim. ''Frank Herbert''. New York, NY: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., Inc. ,1981. (pp.59–60) {{ISBN|0-8044-2666-X}} . "Much of the Bene Gesserit technology of consciousness is based on the insights of general semantics, a philosophy and training method developed in the 1930s by [[Alfred Korzybski]]. Herbert had studied general semantics in San Francisco at about the time he was writing ''Dune''. (At one point, he worked as a ghostwriter for a nationally syndicated column by [[S. I. Hayakawa]], one of the foremost proponents of general semantics.)"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algis Budrys]] wrote that his knowledge of language and linguistics "is worth at least one PhD and the Chair of Philology at a good New England college".&lt;ref name="budrys196604"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Budrys|first=Algis|date=April 1966|title=Galaxy Bookshelf|url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v24n04_1966-04#page/n33/mode/1up|magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction|pages=67–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Learning]], teaching, and [[thinking]].&lt;ref name="gm" /&gt;

Frank Herbert refrained from offering his readers formulaic answers to many of the questions he explored.&lt;ref name="gm" /&gt;

==Status and influence on science fiction==
[[File:Dune.peninsula.tacoma.wa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|The Dune Peninsula at [[Point Defiance Park]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]], with the volcano [[Mount Rainier]] in the distance]]

''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' and the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' saga]] constitute one of the world's best-selling science fiction series and novels; ''Dune'' in particular has received widespread critical acclaim, winning the [[Nebula Award]] in 1965 and sharing the Hugo Award in 1966, and is frequently considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, if not the best.{{sfn|Touponce|1988|p=2|ps= "His dominant intellectual impulse was not to mystify or set himself up as a prophet, but the opposite – to turn what powers of analysis he had (and they were considerable) over to his audience. And this impulse is as manifest in ''Dune'', which many people consider the all-time best science fiction novel, as it is in his computer book, ''Without Me You're Nothing''."}} ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' subscribers voted it the all-time best SF novel in 1975, again in 1987, and the best "before 1990" in 1998.&lt;ref name="isfdb-dune" /&gt;

''Dune'' is considered a landmark novel for a number of reasons:

* ''Dune'' is a landmark of [[soft science fiction]]. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his ''Dune'' universe so that he could address the future of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. ''Dune'' considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.&lt;ref&gt;Building Sci-fi Moviescapes: The Science Behind the Fiction by Matt Hanson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Herbert Biography Author Page|url=http://bestsciencefictionbooks.com/authors/frank-herbert.html|work=bestsciencefictionbooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Frank Herbert was a great popularizer of scientific ideas; many of his fans credit Frank Herbert for introducing them to philosophy and psychology. In ''Dune'', he helped popularize the term ''ecology''. Gerald Jonas explains in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'': "So completely did Mr. Herbert work out the interactions of man and beast and geography and climate that ''Dune'' became the standard for an emerging subgenre of 'ecological' science fiction."
* ''Dune'' is considered an epic example of literary world-building. ''[[Library Journal|The Library Journal]]'' reports that "''Dune'' is to science fiction what ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is to fantasy". [[Arthur C. Clarke]] is quoted as making a similar statement on the back cover of a paper edition of ''Dune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herbert|first1=Frank|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_0425080021|title=Dune|date=January 1977|publisher=Berkley Publishing Corp|isbn=0425-04376-2|edition=Berkley Medallion|location=US|page=Back Cover|ref=berk|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Herbert imagined every facet of his creation. He lovingly included glossaries, quotes, documents, and histories, to bring his universe alive to his readers. No science fiction novel before it had so vividly realized life on another world.&lt;ref name="gm" /&gt;

Herbert never again equalled the critical acclaim he received for ''Dune''. Neither his sequels to ''Dune'' nor any of his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although almost all of them were [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Sellers]].&lt;ref name="KJA"&gt;Speaking at the 2006 induction of Herbert in the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Kevin J.

In recent years, Frank Herbert's son [[Brian Herbert]] and author [[Kevin J. Anderson]] have added to the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' franchise]], using notes left behind by Frank Herbert and discovered over a decade after his death. Brian Herbert and Anderson have written three prequel [[trilogy|trilogies]] (''[[Prelude to Dune]]'', ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' and ''[[Great Schools of Dune]]'') exploring the history of the ''Dune'' universe before the events of the original novel, two novels that take place between novels of the original ''Dune'' sequels (with plans for more), as well as two post-''Chapterhouse Dune'' novels that complete the original series (''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'') based on Frank Herbert's own ''Dune 7'' outline.{{Herbert notes}}

'''''Dune''''', also known as the '''''Dune Chronicles''''', is an American [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] that originated with the 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by [[Frank Herbert]]{{efn|name=analog}} and has continued to add new publications. ''Dune'' is frequently described as the best-selling [[science fiction]] novel in history.&lt;ref name="Touponce 119"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RIF"/&gt; It won the inaugural [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] and the [[Hugo Award]] in 1966 and was later adapted into a [[Dune (1984 film)|1984 film]], a [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 television miniseries]], and a two-parter film series with the [[Dune (2021 film)|first film]] in 2021 and a [[Dune: Part Two|sequel]] in 2024. Herbert wrote five sequels, the first two of which were concomitantly adapted as a [[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|2003 miniseries]]. ''Dune'' has also inspired [[List of games based on Dune|tabletop games]] and a [[List of games based on Dune#Video games|series of video games]]. Since 2009, the names of planets from the ''Dune'' novels have been adopted for the real-world [[Planetary nomenclature|nomenclature]] of plains and other features on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

Frank Herbert died in 1986. Beginning in 1999, his son [[Brian Herbert]] and science fiction author [[Kevin J. Anderson]] published several collections of prequel novels, as well as two sequels that complete the original ''Dune'' series (''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' in 2006 and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' in 2007), partially based on Frank Herbert's notes discovered a decade after his death.{{Herbert notes}}

The political, scientific, and social fictional setting of Herbert's novels and derivative works is known as the '''''Dune'' universe''' or '''Duniverse'''. Set tens of thousands of years in the future, the saga chronicles a civilization that has banned all "[[thinking machines (Dune)|thinking machines]]", which include computers, [[robot]]s, and [[artificial intelligence]]. In their place, civilization has developed advanced mental and physical disciplines as well as advanced technologies that adhere to the ban on computers. Vital to this empire is the harsh [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]], the only known source of the spice [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], the most valuable substance in the universe.

For the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in the [[Arabic language]], as well as the series' "[[Islamic culture|Islamic]] [[Subtext|undertones]]" and themes, a [[Middle East]]ern influence in Herbert's works has been widely noted.

==Premise==
The ''Dune'' saga is set thousands of years in humanity's future. [[Faster-than-light]] travel has been developed, and humans have [[Space colonization|colonized]] a vast number of worlds. However, a great reaction against computers has resulted in a ban on any kind of "thinking machine", with the creation or possession of such [[Capital punishment|punishable by immediate death]]. Despite this prohibition, humanity continues to develop and advance other branches of technology, including [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP) and instruments of war. At the time of the first book's setting, humanity has formed a [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[Galactic empire|interstellar empire]] known as the Imperium, run by several Great Houses that oversee various planets. Of key interest is the planet [[Arrakis]], known as "Dune". A [[desert planet]] with nearly no [[precipitation]], it is the only planet where a special life-extending drug, [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]] or "the spice", can be found. In addition to life extension, melange enhances the mental capacity of humans: it allows for the mutated [[Spacing Guild]] pilots to navigate [[Holtzman effect|folded space]] and travel the distances between planets; and triggers some of the powers of the [[Bene Gesserit]], a religious group that secretly seeks to control the direction humanity takes. Melange is difficult to acquire, not only due to the harsh environment of Arrakis, but also the presence of giant [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]s that are drawn towards any rhythmic sounds on the sands of the desert. Control of Arrakis, its spice production, and the impact on humanity's development become the centerpoints of a millennia-long conflict that develops through the series.

The ''Dune'' universe, set in the distant future of humanity, has a history that stretches thousands of years (some 15,000 years in total) and covers considerable changes in political, social, and religious structure as well as technology. Creative works set in the ''Dune'' universe can be said to fall into five general time periods:

===The Butlerian Jihad===
As explained in ''Dune'', the '''Butlerian Jihad''' is a conflict taking place over 11,000 years in the future&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |url=https://archive.org/details/dune0000herb|url-access=registration |chapter=Appendix II: The Religion of Dune |year=1965 |quote=Mankind's movement through deep space placed a unique stamp on religion during the one hundred and ten centuries that preceded the Butlerian Jihad.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and over 10,000 years before the events of ''Dune''), which results in the total destruction of virtually all forms of "computers, [[thinking machines (Dune)|thinking machines]], and [[cognitive robotics|conscious robots]]".&lt;ref name="Dune Jihad" /&gt; With the prohibition "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind," the creation of even the simplest thinking machines is outlawed and made [[taboo]],&lt;ref name="Dune Jihad" /&gt; which has a profound influence on the [[social engineering (political science)|socio-political]] and technological development of humanity in the ''Dune'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/58/ditom58art.htm|title=History and Historical Effect in Frank Herbert's ''Dune''|last=Lorenzo|first=DiTommaso|date=November 1992|work=[[Science Fiction Studies]]|issue=58|volume=19|via=DePauw.edu|pages=311–325|access-date=July 21, 2009|archive-date=October 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017124444/http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/58/ditom58art.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert refers to the Jihad several times in the novels, but does not give much detail on how he imagined the causes and nature of the conflict.&lt;ref name="SFC 2009-01" /&gt; Critical analysis has often associated the term with [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] and his 1863 essay "[[Darwin among the Machines]]", which advocated the destruction of all advanced machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartanideas.msu.edu/2016/03/29/8624/|title=The Butlerian Jihad and 'Darwin among the Machines'|date=March 29, 2016|first=Stephen|last=Hsu|via=spartanideas.msu.edu|access-date=December 26, 2019|archive-date=December 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224064246/https://spartanideas.msu.edu/2016/03/29/8624/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Herbert's ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' (1981), [[Leto II Atreides]] indicates that the Jihad had been a semi-religious social upheaval initiated by humans who felt repulsed by how guided and controlled they had become by machines.&lt;ref name="God Emperor machines"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[God Emperor of Dune]] |year=1981 |quote=The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines...Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technological reversal leads to the creation of the universal [[#Religion|Orange Catholic Bible]] and the rise of a new [[feudalism|feudal]] pan-galactic empire that lasts for over 10,000 years before Herbert's series begins.&lt;ref name="Dune"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |url=https://archive.org/details/dune0000herb |url-access=registration |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brianpherbert.com/timeline.html |title=Official site: ''Dune'' novels timeline|website=BrianPHerbert.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413030243/http://brianpherbert.com/timeline.html |archive-date=April 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |last=Torkos |first=Attila |date=December 2, 2006|access-date=December 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Secret society|secret societies]] also develop, using [[eugenics]] programs, intensive mental and physical training, and pharmaceutical enhancements to hone human skills to an astonishing degree.&lt;ref name="Dune" /&gt; [[Artificial insemination]] is also prohibited, as explained in ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' (1969), when [[Paul Atreides]] negotiates with the [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]], who is appalled by Paul's suggestion that he impregnate his consort in this manner.&lt;ref name="Messiah"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Dune Messiah]] |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson presents the Jihad as a war between humans and the [[Artificial general intelligence|sentient machines]] they had created, who rise up and nearly destroy humanity.&lt;ref name="Legends"&gt;{{cite serial |last=Herbert |first=Brian |author2=Kevin J. Anderson |title=[[Legends of Dune]] |date=2002–2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series explains that humanity had become entirely complacent and dependent upon thinking machines; recognizing this weakness, a group of ambitious, militant humans calling themselves the [[Titan (Dune)|Titans]] use this widespread reliance on machine intelligence to seize control of the entire universe.&lt;ref name="Legends" /&gt; Their reign lasts for a century; eventually they give too much access and power to the [[artificial intelligence|AI]] program [[Omnius]], which usurps control from the Titans themselves.&lt;ref name="SFC 2009-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Legends" /&gt; Seeing no value in human life, the thinking machines—now including armies of robot soldiers and other aggressive machines—dominate and enslave nearly all of humanity in the universe for 900 years, until a jihad is ignited.&lt;ref name="SFC 2009-01" /&gt; This crusade against the machines lasts for nearly a century, with much loss of human life but ultimately ending in human victory.&lt;ref name="Legends" /&gt;

===The Corrino-led Imperium===
[[File:Corrino Lion.svg|thumb|upright|The golden lion is the symbol of [[House Corrino]].]]
The ancient '''Battle of Corrin'''—occurring 20 years after the end of the Butlerian Jihad—spawns the [[Padishah Emperor]]s of House Corrino, who rule the known universe for millennia by controlling the [[Sardaukar]], a brutally efficient military force. Ten thousand years later, Imperial power is balanced by the assembly of noble houses called the [[Landsraad]], which enforces the [[Great Convention]]'s ban on the use of [[atomics (Dune)|atomics]] against human targets. Though the power of the Corrinos is unrivaled by any individual House, they are in constant competition with each other for political power and stakes in the omnipresent [[CHOAM]] company, a directorship that controls the wealth of the entire Empire. The third primary power in the universe is the [[Spacing Guild]], which monopolizes [[interstellar travel]] and banking. Mutated [[Guild Navigator]]s use the spice drug [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]] to successfully navigate "[[Holtzman effect|folded space]]" and safely guide enormous [[heighliner]] [[starship]]s from planet to planet instantaneously.&lt;ref name="Dune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dune 3-point"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |url=https://archive.org/details/dune0000herb |url-access=registration |year=1965 |quote=We've a three-point civilization: the Imperial Household balanced against the Federated Great Houses of the [[Landsraad]], and between them, the [[Spacing Guild|Guild]] with its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] [[Bene Gesserit]] possess almost superhuman physical, sensory, and deductive powers developed through years of physical and mental conditioning. While positioning themselves to "serve" humanity, the Bene Gesserit pursue their goal to better the human race by subtly and secretly guiding and manipulating the affairs of others to serve their own purposes. By the time of ''Dune'', they have secured a level of control over the current emperor, [[Shaddam IV]], by marrying him to one of their own who intentionally bears him only daughters. The Bene Gesserit also have a secret, millennia-long selective [[Breeding program (Dune)|breeding program]] to bolster and preserve valuable skills and bloodlines as well as to produce a theoretical superhuman male they call the [[Kwisatz Haderach]]. When ''Dune'' begins, the Sisterhood are only one generation away from their desired individual, having manipulated the threads of genes and power for thousands of years to produce the required confluence of events. But [[Lady Jessica]], ordered by the Bene Gesserit to produce a daughter who would breed with the appropriate male to produce the Kwisatz Haderach, instead bears a son—unintentionally producing the Kwisatz Haderach a generation early.&lt;ref name="Dune" /&gt;

"Human computers" known as [[Mentat]]s have been developed and perfected to replace the capacity for logical analysis lost through the prohibition of computers. Through specific training, they learn to enter a heightened mental state in which they can perform complex logical computations that are superior to those of the ancient thinking machines.&lt;ref name="Nerdist Mentat"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/dune-mentats/|title=Who Are the Mentats in ''Dune''?|first=Rose|last=Bueno|website=[[Nerdist]]|date=July 30, 2019|access-date=July 31, 2019|archive-date=April 16, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220416180541/https://nerdist.com/article/dune-mentats/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bene Tleilax]] are amoral merchants who traffic in biological and [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] products such as artificial eyes, "twisted" Mentats, and [[ghola]]s. Finally, the Ixians produce [[State of the art|cutting-edge]] technology that seemingly complies with (but pushes the boundaries of) the prohibitions against thinking machines. The Ixians are very secretive, not only to protect their valuable hold on the industry but also to hide any methods or inventions that may breach the anti-thinking machine protocols.&lt;ref name="Dune" /&gt;

Against this backdrop, the ''Prelude to Dune'' prequel trilogy (1999–2001) chronicles the return from obscurity of House Atreides, whose role in the Butlerian Jihad is all but forgotten. The Imperial House schemes to gain full control of the Empire through the control of melange, precisely at the time that the Bene Gesserit breeding program is nearing fruition.&lt;ref name="Prelude"&gt;{{cite serial |last=Herbert |first=Brian |author2=Kevin J. Anderson |title=[[Prelude to Dune]] |date=1999–2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of the Atreides===
[[File:Atreides guidon pennant.svg|thumb|upright|Atreides "green and black banner", in the form of a "guidon pennant".]]
[[File:Atreides Hawk..svg|thumb|upright|The red hawk is the symbol of [[House Atreides]].]]
As Frank Herbert's ''Dune'' (1965) begins, Duke [[Leto I Atreides|Leto Atreides]] finds himself in a dangerous position. The 81st Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV, has put him in control of the [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]], known as Dune, which is the only source of the all-important spice melange.&lt;ref name="New Yorker Michaud"/&gt; The most valuable commodity in the known universe, the spice not only makes safe and reliable interstellar travel possible, but also prolongs life, protects against disease, and is used by the Bene Gesserit to enhance their abilities. The potential financial gains for House Atreides are mitigated by the fact that mining melange from the desert surface of Arrakis is an expensive and hazardous undertaking, thanks to the treacherous environment and constant threat of giant [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]] that protect the spice. In addition, Leto is aware that Shaddam, feeling threatened by the rising power and influence of the Atreides, has sent him into a trap. Failure to meet or exceed the production volume of his predecessor, the villainous Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]], will negatively affect the position of House Atreides in CHOAM, which relies on spice profits.&lt;ref name="Dune" /&gt; Further, the very presence of the Atreides on Arrakis inflames the long-simmering [[War of Assassins]] between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a feud ignited 10,000 years before when an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Butlerian Jihad.&lt;ref name="Dune Vladimir"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses) |year=1965 |quote=Vladimir Harkonnen...the direct-line male descendant of the Bashar Abulurd Harkonnen who was banished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dune Feud"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |url=https://archive.org/details/dune0000herb |url-access=registration |year=1965 |quote=The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a cousin of the royal blood—no matter what the distance—while the Harkonnen titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice after the Battle of Corrin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The little-understood native population of Arrakis are the [[Fremen]], long overlooked by the Imperium. Considered backward savages, the Fremen are an extremely hardy people and exist in large numbers, their culture built around the commodity of water, which is extremely scarce on Arrakis. The Fremen await the coming of a prophesied [[messiah]], not suspecting that this prophecy had been planted in their legends by the [[Missionaria Protectiva]], an arm of the Bene Gesserit dedicated to religious manipulation to ease the path of the Sisterhood when necessary. In ''Dune'', the so-called "Arrakis Affair" puts unexpected Kwisatz Haderach [[Paul Atreides]] in control of first the Fremen people and then Arrakis itself. Absolute control over the spice supply allows Paul to depose Shaddam and become ruler of the known universe, with Shaddam's eldest daughter [[Princess Irulan]] as his consort.&lt;ref name="Dune" /&gt; With a bloody [[jihad]] subsequently unleashed across the universe in Paul's name but out of his control, the Bene Gesserit, Tleilaxu, Spacing Guild, and House Corrino conspire to dethrone him in ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name="Messiah" /&gt; Though the plot fails, the Atreides Empire continues to devolve in ''[[Children of Dune]]'' (1976) as the religion built around Paul falters, Irulan's sister [[Wensicia]] conspires to place her son [[Farad'n]] on the throne, and Paul's twin heirs [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] rise to power.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Children of Dune]] |year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Heroes of Dune'' series (2008–2009) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson chronicles the major events that take place between ''Dune: House Corrino'' (2001) and ''Dune: The Duke of Caladan'' (2020), between ''Dune'' (1965) and ''Dune Messiah'' (1969), and between ''Dune Messiah'' and ''Children of Dune'' (1976).&lt;ref name="Heroes"&gt;{{cite serial |last=Herbert |first=Brian |author2=Kevin J. Anderson |title=[[Heroes of Dune]] |date=2008–2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The reign and fall of the God Emperor===
[[File:Harkonnen Griffin.svg|thumb|upright|The blue griffin is the symbol of [[House Harkonnen]].]]
At the time of ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]'' (1981), Paul's son, the God Emperor Leto II Atreides, has ruled the Empire for 3,500 years from the verdant face of a transformed Arrakis; melange production has ceased. Leto has forced the sandworms into extinction, except for the larval [[sandtrout]] with which he had forged a [[symbiosis]], transforming him into a human-sandworm hybrid. Human civilization before his rule had suffered from twin weaknesses: that it could be controlled by a single authority, and that it was totally dependent upon melange, found on only one planet in the known universe. Leto's prescient visions had shown that humanity would be threatened by extinction in any number of ways; his solution was to place humanity on his "[[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]," a plan for humanity's survival. Leto governs as a benevolent tyrant, providing for his people's physical needs, but denying them any spiritual outlets other than his own compulsory religion (as well as maintaining a monopoly on spice and thus total control of its use). Personal violence of any kind is banned, as is nearly all space travel, creating a pent-up demand for freedom and travel. The Bene Gesserit, Ixians, and Tleilaxu find themselves seeking ways to regain some of their former power or unseat Leto altogether. Leto also conducts his own selective breeding program among the descendants of his twin sister Ghanima, finally arriving at [[Siona Atreides|Siona]], daughter of [[Moneo Atreides|Moneo]], whose actions are hidden from prescient vision. Leto engineers his own assassination, knowing it will result in rebellion and revolt but also in an explosion in travel and colonization. The death of Leto's body also produces new sandtrout, which will eventually give rise to a population of sandworms and a new cycle of spice production.&lt;ref name="God Emperor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=God Emperor of Dune |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The return from the Scattering===
&lt;!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[The Scattering (Dune)]] --&gt;
In the aftermath of the fall of the God Emperor, chaos and severe famine on many worlds cause trillions of humans to set off into the freedom of unknown space and spread out across the universe. This [[diaspora]] is later called '''the Scattering''' and, combined with the invisibility of Atreides descendants to prescient vision, assures that humanity has forever escaped the threat of total extinction. At the time of ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' (1984) and ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'' (1985)—1500 years after Leto's death—the turmoil is settling into a new pattern; the balance of power in the Old Empire, as it is now called, rests among the Ixians, the Bene Gesserit, and the Tleilaxu. The Spacing Guild has been forever weakened by the development of Ixian machines capable of navigation in foldspace, practically replacing Guild Navigators. The Bene Gesserit, through manipulation of the Priesthood of the Divided God, control the sandworms and their planet, now called Rakis, but the Tleilaxu have discovered how to produce melange using their axlotl tanks in quantities that greatly exceed natural melange harvests. This balance of power is shattered by a large influx of people from the Scattering, some fleeing persecution by an as-yet unknown enemy. Among the returning people, the Bene Gesserit finds its match in a violent and corrupt matriarchal society known as the [[Honored Matres]], whom they suspect may be descended from some of their own sent out in the Scattering. As a bitter and bloody war erupts between the orders, it ultimately becomes clear that joining the two organizations into a single [[New Sisterhood]] with shared abilities is their best chance to fight the approaching enemy.&lt;ref name="Heretics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Heretics of Dune]] |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapterhouse"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Chapterhouse: Dune]] |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequels ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson complete the original series and wrap up storylines that began with ''Heretics of Dune''.

==Development and publication==

===Original series===
Herbert's interest in the desert setting of ''Dune'' and its challenges is attributed to research he began in 1957 for a never-completed article about a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] experiment using [[poverty grass (disambiguation)|poverty grass]] to stabilize damaging sand [[dune]]s, which could "swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, and highways."&lt;ref name="Road 263"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Road to Dune]]|date=August 11, 2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/roadtodune00herb/page/263 263–264]|last1=Herbert|first1=Frank|author-link=Frank Herbert|first2=Brian|last2=Herbert|author2-link=Brian Herbert|first3=Kevin J.|last3=Anderson|author3-link=Kevin J.

===Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson===
Over a decade after Herbert's death, his son Brian Herbert enlisted science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson to coauthor a [[trilogy]] of ''Dune'' [[prequel]] novels that would come to be called the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' series.&lt;ref name="Digitalwebbing notes 2004"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ascher |first=Ian |date=2004 |url=http://www.digitalwebbing.com/interviews/042104_anderson.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703213605/http://www.digitalwebbing.com/interviews/042104_anderson.html |title=Kevin J.

In 1985, Frank Herbert wrote an illustrated short work called "[[The Road to Dune (short story)|The Road to Dune]]", set sometime between the events of ''Dune'' and ''Dune Messiah''. Published in Herbert's [[short story collection]] ''[[Eye (short story collection)|Eye]]'', it takes the form of a guidebook for pilgrims to [[Arrakis]] and features images (with descriptions) of some of the devices and characters presented in the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Eye (short story collection)|Eye]] |chapter=[[The Road to Dune (short story)|The Road to Dune]] |year=1985 |isbn=0-425-08398-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Herbert and Anderson have written eight [[Dune short stories|''Dune'' short stories]] and four ''Dune'' novellas, most of them related to and published around their novels.

==Themes and influences==
The ''Dune'' series is a landmark of [[soft science fiction]]. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his ''Dune'' universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. ''Dune'' considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Sci-fi Moviescapes: The Science Behind the Fiction|first=Matt|last=Hanson|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2005|isbn=9780240807720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Michaud of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called the originating novel ''Dune'' "an epic of political betrayal, ecological [[brinkmanship]], and messianic deliverance."&lt;ref name="New Yorker Michaud"/&gt; Director [[John Harrison (director)|John Harrison]], who adapted ''Dune'' for [[Syfy]]'s [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 miniseries]], called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of "the human condition and its moral dilemmas", and said:
{{Quote|A lot of people refer to ''Dune'' as science fiction. I never do. I consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition, a story of myth and legend not unlike the ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' or any messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future... The story is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it. In the 1960s, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out. Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity necessary to all.&lt;ref name="NYT 2000"/&gt;}}

Novelist [[Brian Herbert]], Frank Herbert's son and biographer, explained that "Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren't so different from systems we know."&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Setting"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |chapter=Afterword by Brian Herbert |year=1965 |edition=Kindle |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |page=876}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the invaluable drug [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]] "represents, among other things, the finite resource of oil".&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Setting"/&gt; Michaud explained, "Imagine a substance with the combined worldwide value of cocaine and petroleum and you will have some idea of the power of melange."&lt;ref name="New Yorker Michaud"/&gt; Each chapter of ''Dune'' begins with an [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] excerpted from the fictional writings of the character [[Princess Irulan]]. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context, and other details intended by Herbert to enhance understanding of his complex fictional universe and themes.&lt;ref name="Tor 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torforgeblog.com/2014/02/03/quotes-from-the-end-of-the-world/ |title=Quotes from the End of the World |last=Edison |first=David |website=Tor.com |date=February 3, 2014 |access-date=June 29, 2014 |archive-date=July 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708041344/http://torforgeblog.com/2014/02/03/quotes-from-the-end-of-the-world/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michaud wrote in 2013, "With daily reminders of the intensifying effects of global warming, the spectre of a worldwide water shortage, and continued political upheaval in the oil-rich Middle East, it is possible that ''Dune'' is even more relevant now than when it was first published."&lt;ref name="New Yorker Michaud"/&gt; Praising Herbert's "clever authorial decision" to excise robots and computers ("two staples of the genre") from his fictional universe, he suggested that "This de-emphasis on technology throws the focus back on people. It also allows for the presence of a religious mysticism uncommon in science fiction."&lt;ref name="New Yorker Michaud"/&gt;

===Environmentalism and ecology===
The originating novel ''Dune'' has been called the "first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale".&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Edward |first2=Farah |last2=Mendlesohn |title=The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2003 |pages=183–184 |isbn=0-521-01657-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. ''Dune'' responded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of life on [[Arrakis]], from giant [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]s (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life-forms adapted to live with limited water. ''Dune'' was followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such as ''[[A Door into Ocean]]'' (1986) and ''[[Red Mars]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; Environmentalists have pointed out that ''Dune''{{'s}} popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex, almost living, thing, in combination with the first images of Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the international [[Earth Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Robert L. |editor-last1=France |title=Facilitating Watershed Management: Fostering Awareness and Stewardship |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]] |location=Lanham |year=2005 |page=105 |isbn=0-7425-3364-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declining empires===
Lorenzo DiTommaso compared ''Dune''{{'s}} portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', which argues that [[Christianity]] allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of [[Ancient Rome]]. In "History and Historical Effect in Frank Herbert's ''Dune''" (1992), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam IV]] on his home planet of [[Kaitain (Dune)|Kaitain]] and of the Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as "parasites". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt, materially indulgent, and a sexual degenerate. Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall'' partly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack.

Similarly, the Emperor's [[Sardaukar]] fighters are little match for the [[Fremen]] of Arrakis because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others.&lt;ref name="DiTommaso"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/58/ditom58art.htm|title=History and Historical Effect in Frank Herbert's ''Dune''|last=Lorenzo|first=DiTommaso|date=November 1992|work=[[Science Fiction Studies]]|issue=58|volume=19, Part 3|publisher=[[DePauw University]]|pages=311–325|access-date=July 21, 2009|archive-date=October 17, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017124444/http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/58/ditom58art.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal by genetic mixing of successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by [[Paul Atreides]], described by Herbert as depicting "war as a collective orgasm" (drawing on Norman Walter's 1950 ''The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare''). These themes reappear in ''[[God Emperor of Dune]]''{{'s}} [[#The return from the Scattering|Scattering]] and [[Leto II Atreides]]'s all-female [[Fish Speaker]] army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/1950-walter-thesexualcycleofhumanwarfare.djvu|title=The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare|date=1950|first=Norman|last=Walter|via=gwern.net|access-date=June 28, 2019|archive-date=April 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412132316/https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/1950-walter-thesexualcycleofhumanwarfare.djvu|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jacurutu.com/viewtopic.php?t=1214#p38497|title=Listening To The Left Hand|first=Frank|last=Herbert|journal=[[Harper's]]|date=December 1973|via=jacurutu.com|access-date=June 28, 2019|archive-date=June 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616122440/http://www.jacurutu.com/viewtopic.php?t=1214#p38497|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroism===
Brian Herbert wrote that "''Dune'' is a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange...[that] resembles the myth described by an unknown English poet in ''[[Beowulf]]'', the compelling tale of a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs."&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Setting"/&gt;

Paul's rise to superhuman status follows the [[hero's journey]] template; after unfortunate circumstances are forced onto him, he suffers a long period of hardship and exile, and finally confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tilley|first=E. Allen|title=The Modes of Fiction: A Plot Morphology|journal=[[College English]]|date=February 1978|volume=39|issue=6|pages=692–706|doi=10.2307/375873|jstor=375873}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hume|first=Kathryn|title=Romance: A Perdurable Pattern|journal=College English|date=October 1974|volume=36|issue=2|pages=129–146|doi=10.2307/374771|jstor=374771}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, ''Dune'' is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Attebery|first=Brian|title=Decoding Gender in Science Fiction|location=New York|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=2002|page=66|isbn=0-415-93949-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Herbert said in 1979, "The bottom line of the ''Dune'' trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better [to] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes."&lt;ref name="Clareson"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clareson |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas D. Clareson |title=Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction: the Formative Period |location=[[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia, SC]] |publisher=[[University of South Carolina Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OlTc6yOyYbwC&amp;dq=muad%27dib+mahdi&amp;pg=PA171 |year=1992 |pages=169–173 |isbn=0-87249-870-0 |access-date=2023-02-11 |archive-date=2023-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408131738/https://books.google.com/books?id=OlTc6yOyYbwC&amp;dq=muad%27dib+mahdi&amp;pg=PA171 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in 1985, "''Dune'' was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question."&lt;ref name="Eye"/&gt;

Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes of ''Dune'' from earlier heroes such as [[Superman]], [[A. E. van Vogt|van Vogt]]'s [[Gilbert Gosseyn]] and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of "painful and slow personal progress." And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through "the application of mystical philosophies and techniques." For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, [[Swordmasters of Ginaz]] and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).&lt;ref name="prieto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prieto-Pablos|first=Juan A.|title=The Ambivalent Hero of Contemporary Fantasy and Science Fiction|journal=[[Extrapolation (journal)|Extrapolation]]|volume=32|issue=1|pages=64–80|publisher=[[University of Texas at Brownsville]]|date=Spring 1991|doi=10.3828/extr.1991.32.1.64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle-Eastern and Islamic influences===

==== Additional linguistic and historic influences ====
In addition to Arabic, ''Dune'' derives words and names from multiple other languages, including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Latin]], [[Chakobsa]], the [[Nahuatl]] language of the [[Aztecs]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[East Indian language|East Indian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Old English]].&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Language"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Frank|title=Dune|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1965|edition=Kindle|page=878|chapter=Afterword by Brian Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the inspiration from Lesley Blanch's ''The Sabres of Paradise'', there are also allusions to the Tsarist-era [[Russian nobility]] and [[Cossacks]].&lt;ref name="LAR" /&gt; Frank Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind the aristocratic families in ''Dune'' was "aristocratic bureaucracy" which he saw as analogous to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tim O'Reilly - Frank Herbert: Chapter 5: Rogue Gods - O'Reilly Media|url=https://www.oreilly.com/tim/herbert/ch05.html|access-date=2021-11-07|website=www.oreilly.com|language=en|archive-date=2021-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107074914/https://www.oreilly.com/tim/herbert/ch05.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Herbert|first=Frank|date=1985-04-17|title=Frank Herbert speaking at UCLA 4/17/1985|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IfgBX1EW00|website=YouTube|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles Comm Studies|access-date=2021-11-07|archive-date=2021-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107074907/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IfgBX1EW00|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
&lt;!--'Zensunni' redirects here--&gt;
Brian Herbert called the ''Dune'' universe "a spiritual melting pot", noting that his father, Frank Herbert, incorporated elements of a variety of religions, including [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism|Sufi mysticism]] and other Islamic belief systems, [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Religion"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |chapter=Afterword by Brian Herbert |year=1965 |edition=[[Amazon Kindle]] |publisher=Penguin Group |page=873}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that Frank Herbert's fictional future in which "religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms" represents the author's solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claim to have "the one and only revelation."&lt;ref name="Dune Afterword Religion"/&gt; Frank Herbert writes that, in the aftermath of the technology-purging Butlerian Jihad, the Bene Gesserit composed the Azhar Book, which "preserves the great secrets of the most ancient faiths".&lt;ref name="Appendix II"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |chapter=Appendix II: The Religion of Dune |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, an [[ecumenical council]] created a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religion defined by the '''Orange Catholic Bible''', which would become the primary orthodox religious text in the universe.&lt;ref name="Appendix II"/&gt; Its title suggests a merging of Protestantism ([[Orange Order]]) and Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlbSrcGnhRIC&amp;pg=PA187|title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert|last=Herbert|first=Brian|date=2004-07-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780765306470|pages=187|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AajtCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|title=The History of Science Fiction|last=Roberts|first=A.|date=2005-11-28|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230554658|pages=235|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert writes in the glossary of ''Dune'':

Early in his newspaper career, Frank Herbert was introduced to [[Zen]], a [[East Asian Buddhism|school]] of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], by two [[Jungian]] psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who "gave a crucial boost to his thinking".&lt;ref name="O'Reilly C2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://tim.oreilly.com/herbert/ch02.html|title=Frank Herbert|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly|chapter=Chapter 2: Under Pressure|access-date=March 26, 2019|archive-date=December 30, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230080811/http://tim.oreilly.com/herbert/ch02.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zen teachings ultimately had "a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert's] work".&lt;ref name="O'Reilly C2"/&gt; Throughout the ''Dune'' series and particularly in ''Dune'', Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from Zen Buddhism.&lt;ref name="New Yorker Michaud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Reilly C2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unpublished interview with Frank Herbert and Professor Willis E.

{{quote|What especially pleases me is to see the interwoven themes, the fuguelike relationships of images that exactly replay the way ''Dune'' took shape ... I involved myself with recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul's gift of prescience—the Presbyterian fixation? For the Delphic Oracle to perform, it must tangle itself in a web of [[predestination]]. Yet predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It's like a koan, a Zen mind breaker.&lt;ref name="Genesis"/&gt;}}

The Bene Gesserit practice "religious engineering" ([[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]), through the [[Missionaria Protectiva]], which spreads contrived myths, prophecies and superstition on primitive worlds so that the Sisterhood may at a much later time exploit embedded belief to advance their universal strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |chapter=Terminology of the Imperium: Missionaria Protectiva |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert suggests a process of wish-fulfilling recognition of "sacred" texts created by the Bene Gesserit's master plan in a particular person, and transforming events into [[doxa|common belief]].&lt;ref name="HoaglandSarwal2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ericka Hoagland|author2=Reema Sarwal|author3=Andy Sawyer|title=Science Fiction, Imperialism and the Third World: Essays on Postcolonial Literature and Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEzQw_LW_U8C&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=February 24, 2011|date=August 24, 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4789-3|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novels, the Fremen religion on Arrakis has been thus influenced, allowing Paul to embody their prophesied messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=Dune |chapter=Appendix III: Report on Bene Gesserit Motives and Purposes |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul is agonized by visions of terrible jihad which will destroy the Imperium, but he becomes Paul Muad'Dib, [[Mahdi]] of the Fremen, accepting the role imposed by Bene Gesserit.

Jon Michaud noted in 2013 in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "what's curious about ''Dune''{{'s}} stature is that it has not penetrated popular culture in the way that ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' have."&lt;ref name="New Yorker Michaud"/&gt; He praised Herbert's "clever authorial decision" to excise robots and computers ("two staples of the genre") from his fictional universe, but suggested that this may be one explanation why ''Dune'' lacks "true fandom among science-fiction fans".&lt;ref name="New Yorker Michaud"/&gt;

Since 2009, the names of planets from the ''Dune'' novels have been adopted for the real-world [[planetary nomenclature|nomenclature]] of plains ([[planitiae]]) and complexes of valleys ([[labyrinthi (planetary geology)|labyrinthi]]) on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref name="Titan"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/HotTopics/index.php?/archives/369-New-Name,-Descriptor-Term,-and-Theme-Approved-for-Use-on-Titan.html |title=USGS Astrogeology Hot Topics: New Name, Descriptor Term, and Theme Approved for Use on Titan |first=Jennifer |last=Blue |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |via=Astrogeology.usgs.gov |date=August 4, 2009 |access-date=September 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101075856/http://astrogeology.usgs.gov/HotTopics/index.php?%2Farchives%2F369-New-Name%2C-Descriptor-Term%2C-and-Theme-Approved-for-Use-on-Titan.html |archive-date=November 1, 2014 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Titan Planitiae"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?target=TITAN&amp;featureType=Planitia,%20planitiae |title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature: Titan Planitiae |publisher=United States Geological Survey |via=Planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov |access-date=January 3, 2015 |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016163143/http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?target=TITAN&amp;featureType=Planitia,%20planitiae |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Titan Labyrinthi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?target=TITAN&amp;featureType=Labyrinthus,%20labyrinthi |title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature: Titan Labyrinthi |publisher=United States Geological Survey |via=Planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov |access-date=January 3, 2015 |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016163143/http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?target=TITAN&amp;featureType=Labyrinthus,%20labyrinthi |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planet names used to date include [[Arrakis]], [[Caladan]], [[Giedi Prime]], [[Kaitain (Dune)|Kaitain]], [[Salusa Secundus]], and [[Tleilax]].&lt;ref name="Titan Planitiae" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Titan Labyrinthi" /&gt; The [[Hagal dune field]] and other sites on [[Mars]] are informally named after planets mentioned in the ''Dune'' series.&lt;ref name="Icarus"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.J.

In 1973, director and writer [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] set about creating a cinematic adaptation, taking over the option that producer [[Arthur P. Jacobs]] had taken on the film adaptation rights in 1973 shortly before his death. Jodorowsky approached, among others, [[Peter Gabriel]], the prog rock groups [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Magma (band)|Magma]] for some of the music, artists [[H. R. Giger]] and [[Jean Giraud]] for set and character design, and [[Dan O'Bannon]] for special effects. Jodorowsky cast  his own son [[Brontis Jodorowsky]] in the lead role of Paul Atreides, [[Salvador Dalí]] as Shaddam IV, Padishah Emperor, [[Amanda Lear]] as Princess Irulan, [[Orson Welles]] as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, [[Gloria Swanson]] as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, [[David Carradine]] as Duke Leto Atreides, [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Lady Jessica, [[Alain Delon]] as Duncan Idaho, [[Hervé Villechaize]] as Gurney Halleck, [[Udo Kier]] as Piter De Vries, and [[Mick Jagger]] as Feyd-Rautha.&lt;ref name="Metal Hurlant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/jodorowsky.asp |title=''Dune: Le Film Que Vous Ne Verrez Jamais'' (''Dune'': The Film You Will Never See) |first=Alejandro |last=Jodorowsky |work=[[Métal Hurlant]] |issue=107 |year=1985 |publisher=DuneInfo.com |access-date=February 20, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429101454/http://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/jodorowsky.asp |archive-date=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing a vast script, so expansive that the movie was thought to potentially last 14 hours. The project, nevertheless, was scrapped for financial reasons, leaving Jodorowsky's unfinished handwritten script in a notebook that was partially published as a facsimile in 2012 as part of the ''100 Notes – 100 Thoughts'' catalog of the [[DOCUMENTA (13)|13th]] ''[[documenta]]'' exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatjecantz.de/alejandro-jodorowsky-2753-1.html|title=Alejandro Jodorowsky|last=Cantz|first=Hatje|work=Hatje Cantz|access-date=May 16, 2014|archive-date=December 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226063521/http://www.hatjecantz.de/alejandro-jodorowsky-2753-1.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Pavich]] directed a documentary about this unrealized project entitled ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]'', which premiered at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2013,&lt;ref name="Variety Jodorowsky"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/hold-directors-fortnight-1200407774/|title=U.S. Fare Looms Large in Directors' Fortnight|last=Keslassy|first=Elsa|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 23, 2013|access-date=April 30, 2013|archive-date=April 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426003118/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/hold-directors-fortnight-1200407774/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released theatrically in March 2014.&lt;ref name="Geek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/dune/152053/jodorowskys-dune-gets-a-release-date-from-sony|title=''Jodorowsky's Dune'' Gets a Release Date From Sony|last=Cecchini|first=Mike|work=Den of Geek|date=August 25, 2013|access-date=December 8, 2014|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092911/http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/dune/152053/jodorowskys-dune-gets-a-release-date-from-sony|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Universal Pictures]] released ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'', a feature film adaptation of the novel by director and writer [[David Lynch]].&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Dune'' (1984)|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dune.htm|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=January 15, 2015|archive-date=May 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210502192320/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3629024769/weekend/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Paul Atreides, [[Jürgen Prochnow]] as Duke Leto Atreides, [[Francesca Annis]] as Lady Jessica, [[Sean Young]] as Chani, [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, [[Siân Phillips]] as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, [[Max von Sydow]] as Doctor Kynes, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] as Feyd-Rautha, [[Freddie Jones]] as Thufir Hawat, [[Richard Jordan]] as Duncan Idaho, [[Everett McGill]] as Stilgar, [[Patrick Stewart]] as Gurney Halleck, [[Dean Stockwell]] as Doctor Wellington Yueh, and [[José Ferrer]] as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.&lt;ref name="NYT 1984-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F06E2D71238F937A25751C1A962948260|title=Movie Review: ''Dune'' (1984)|last=Maslin|first=Janet|author-link=Janet Maslin|date=December 14, 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 15, 2010|archive-date=March 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311010339/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F06E2D71238F937A25751C1A962948260|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a commercial and critical failure upon release, Frank Herbert himself was reportedly pleased with the movie, as it stayed more faithful to the book than earlier movie adaptation attempts. However, he had his reservations on its failures at the time, citing the lack of "imagination" in its marketing and estimated costs, and some of the filmmaker's production techniques.&lt;ref name="Eye"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |title=[[Eye (short story collection)|Eye]] |chapter=Introduction |year=1985 |isbn=0-425-08398-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Children of Dune''''' is a 1976 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Frank Herbert]], the third in his [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' series]] of six novels. It was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' in 1976, and was the last ''Dune'' novel to be serialized before book publication.

At the end of ''[[Dune Messiah]]'', [[Paul Atreides]] walks into the desert, a blind man, leaving his twin children [[Leto II Atreides|Leto]] and [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]] in the care of the [[Fremen]], while his sister [[Alia Atreides|Alia]] rules the universe as regent. Awakened in the womb by the [[Melange (fictional drug)|spice]], the children are the heirs to Paul's [[prescience (Dune)|prescient]] vision of the fate of the universe, a role that Alia desperately craves. [[House Corrino]] schemes to return to the throne, while the [[Bene Gesserit]] make common cause with the [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] and [[Spacing Guild]] to gain control of the spice and the children of Paul Atreides.

Initially selling over 75,000 copies, it became the first hardcover best-seller ever in the science fiction field. The novel was critically well-received for its plot, action, and atmosphere, and was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] in 1977. ''Dune Messiah'' (1969) and ''Children of Dune'' were collectively adapted by the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 2003 into a miniseries titled ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]''.

==Plot==
Nine years after Emperor Paul Muad'Dib walked into the desert, blind, the ecological transformation of [[Arrakis|Dune]] has reached the point where some Fremen are living without [[stillsuit]]s in the less arid climate and have started to move out of the sietches and into the villages and cities. As the old ways erode, more and more pilgrims arrive to experience the planet of Muad'Dib. The Imperial high council has lost its political might and is powerless to control the Jihad.

Paul's young twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, have concluded that their guardian Alia has succumbed to [[Abomination (Dune)|Abomination]]—possession by her grandfather [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]]—and fear that a similar fate awaits them. They (and Alia) also realize that the [[terraforming]] of Dune will kill all the [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]], thus destroying the source of the spice, but Baron Harkonnen desires this outcome. Leto also fears that, like his father, he will become trapped by his prescience.

Meanwhile, a new religious figure called "The Preacher" has risen in the desert, rallying against the religious government's injustices and the changes among the Fremen. Some Fremen believe he is Paul Atreides. Princess [[Wensicia]] of the fallen House Corrino on [[Salusa Secundus]] plots to assassinate the twins and regain power for her House.

[[Lady Jessica]] returns to Arrakis and recognizes that her daughter is possessed, but finds no signs of Abomination in the twins. Leto arranges for Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] to protect his sister if there is an attempt on their lives. The Preacher journeys to Salusa Secundus to meet Wensicia's son [[Farad'n]], and in return pledges the [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]] as an agent of House Corrino. Alia attempts to assassinate Jessica, who escapes into the desert with Duncan's help, precipitating a rebellion among the Fremen. The twins anticipate and survive the Corrino assassination plot. Leto leaves to seek out Jacurutu, a mythical Fremen sietch and possible holdout of the Preacher, while Ghanima, changing her memory with self-hypnosis, reports (and believes) that her brother has been murdered. Duncan and Jessica flee to Salusa Secundus, where Jessica begins to mentor Farad'n. He sidelines and publicly denounces his regent mother Wensicia over the assassination attempt on the twins, and allies with the [[Bene Gesserit]], who promise to marry him to Ghanima and support his bid to become Emperor.

A band of Fremen outlaws capture Leto and force him to undergo the spice trance at the suggestion of [[Gurney Halleck]], who has infiltrated the group on Jessica's orders. Leto's spice-induced visions show him myriad possible futures where humanity becomes extinct and only one where it survives. He names this future "The Golden Path" and resolves to bring it to fruition—something that his father, who had already glimpsed this future, refused to do. He escapes his captors and sacrifices his humanity in pursuit of the Golden Path by physically fusing with a school of [[sandtrout]], the larval form of sandworms, in the process gaining superhuman strength and near-invulnerability. He travels across the desert destroying [[Qanat|qanats]] to slow down the ecological transformation of Dune, and eventually confronts the Preacher, who is indeed Paul.

Duncan returns to Arrakis and provokes Stilgar into killing him so that Stilgar is forced to take Ghanima and go into hiding. Eventually though, Alia recaptures Ghanima and arranges her marriage to Farad'n, planning to exploit the expected chaos when Ghanima kills him to avenge her brother's murder. The Preacher and Leto return to the capital, where Lady Jessica and Farad'n have arrived for his betrothal to Ghanima, to confront Alia. Upon arriving, Paul is publicly murdered by agents of her government, to Alia's horror. Leto reveals himself in a display of superhuman strength and triggers the return of Ghanima's genuine memories. He confronts Alia and offers to help her overcome her possession, but Baron Harkonnen resists. Alia manages to take her own life by throwing herself off a high balcony.

Leto declares himself Emperor and asserts control over the Fremen. Farad'n enlists in his service and delivers control of the Corrino armies and his [[Sardaukar]]. In describing the Golden Path to Farad'n, Leto reveals that he will live for thousands of years due to the sandworm skin and genetics he is encased in. Leto marries Ghanima to consolidate power, but Farad'n is her true consort so the Atreides line can continue.

==Publication history==
Parts of ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' and ''Children of Dune'' were written before ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxxwnkPHlfEC&amp;q=%22parts%20of%20dune%20messiah%20and%20children%20of%20dune%20were%20written%20before%20dune%20was%20completed%22|title=Children of Dune|chapter=When I Was Writing ''Dune''|first=Frank|last=Herbert|date=1976|edition=2008|publisher=[[Penguin Publishing Group]]|isbn=9781440630514|access-date=May 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Children of Dune'' was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' in 1976, and was the last ''Dune'' novel to be serialized before book publication.

==Analysis==
Herbert likened the initial trilogy of novels (''Dune'', ''Dune Messiah'', and ''Children of Dune'') to a [[fugue]] – ''Dune'' was a heroic melody, ''Dune Messiah'' was its [[Inversion (music)|inversion]], while ''Children of Dune'' expands the number of interplaying themes. Paul rises to power in ''Dune'' by seizing control of the single critical resource in the universe, melange. His enemies are dead or overthrown, and he is set to take the reins of power and bring a hard but enlightened peace to the universe. Herbert chose in the books that followed to undermine Paul's triumph with a string of failures and philosophical paradoxes.&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Herbert|first=Frank|url=http://www.frankherbert.org/news/genesis.html |title=''Dune''Genesis|access-date=February 14, 2014 |publisher=FrankHerbert.org|work=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]|date=July 1980 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107220342/http://www.frankherbert.org/news/genesis.html |archive-date=January 7, 2012 |quote=Of course there are other themes and fugal interplays in ''Dune'' and throughout the trilogy.

'''''God Emperor of Dune''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Frank Herbert]], published in 1981. The fourth in his [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' series]] of six novels, it was ranked as the No. 11 hardcover fiction best seller of 1981 by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.

==Plot==
[[Leto II Atreides]], the God Emperor, has ruled the universe as a tyrant for 3,500 years after becoming a hybrid of human and giant [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]] in ''[[Children of Dune]]''. The death of all other sandworms as a result of the [[terraforming]] of [[Arrakis]], and his control of the remaining supply of the all-important drug [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], has allowed him to keep civilization under his complete command. Leto has been physically transformed into a worm, retaining only his human face and arms, and though he is now seemingly immortal and invulnerable to harm, he is prone to instinct-driven bouts of violence when provoked to anger. As a result, his rule is one of religious awe and [[Despotism|despotic]] fear. 

Leto has disbanded the [[Landsraad]] to all but a few Great Houses; the remaining powers defer to his authority, although they individually conspire against him in secret. The [[Fremen]] have long since lost their identity and military power, and have been replaced as the Imperial army by the [[Fish Speakers]], an all-female army  who obey Leto without question. He has rendered the human population into a state of trans-galactic stagnation; space travel is non-existent to most people in his Empire, which he has deliberately kept to a near-[[medieval]] level of technological sophistication. All of this he has done in accordance with a prophecy divined through precognition that will establish an enforced peace preventing humanity from destroying itself through aggressive behavior.

The [[desert planet]] Arrakis has been entirely transformed by terraforming into a lush forested biosphere with the exception of "The Sareer", a single section of desert retained by Leto for his Citadel. A string of [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]]s have served Leto over the millennia, and Leto has also fostered the bloodline of his twin sister [[Ghanima Atreides|Ghanima]]. Her descendant [[Moneo Atreides]] is Leto's [[majordomo]] and closest confidante, while Moneo's daughter [[Siona Atreides|Siona]] has become the leader of an Arrakis-based rebellion against Leto. She steals a set of secret records from his archives, not realizing that he has allowed it. Leto intends to breed Siona with the latest Duncan ghola, but is aware that the ghola, moved by his own morality, may try to assassinate him before this can occur. 

The [[Ixian]]s send a new ambassador named [[Hwi Noree]] to serve Leto, and though he realizes that she has been specifically designed and trained to ensnare him, he cannot resist falling in love with her. She agrees to marry him. Leto tests Siona by taking her out to the middle of the desert. After improperly using her [[stillsuit]] to preserve moisture, dehydration forces her to accept Leto's offer of [[Melange (fictional drug)|spice]] essence from his body to replenish her. Awakened to Leto's prophecy, which he calls the [[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]], Siona is convinced of the importance of it. She remains dedicated to Leto's destruction, and an errant rainstorm demonstrates to her, his mortal vulnerability to water.

When Idaho falls in love and copulates with Hwi, Moneo sends him and Siona out to Tuono Village, an outcropping along the Royal Procession road, to keep them safe from Leto's wrath. Leto changes the venue of his wedding from Tabur Village to Tuono Village. Siona and Idaho overcome a searing mutual hatred of each other to plan an assassination. As Leto's wedding procession moves across a high bridge over a river, Siona's associate [[Nayla (Dune)|Nayla]] destroys the support beams with a [[lasgun]]. The bridge collapses and Leto's entourage, including Hwi, plunge to their deaths into the river below. Leto's body rends apart in the water; the [[sandtrout]] which are part of his body encyst the water and scurry off, while the worm portion burns and disintegrates on the shore. 

With his dying breaths, Leto reveals a secret portion of the Golden Path: the production of a human who is invisible to prescient vision. Having begun millennia before with the union of Leto's twin sister Ghanima and [[Farad'n]] of [[House Corrino]], Siona is the finished result, and she and her descendants will retain this ability. He explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles, free to scatter throughout the universe, never again to face complete domination or complete destruction. After revealing the location of his secret spice hoard, Leto dies, leaving Duncan and Siona to face the task of managing the empire. 

The Ixians have also begun the construction of navigation computers that will render the [[Spacing Guild]]'s [[Guild Navigator|Navigator]]s obsolete. Leto's death causes [[The Scattering (Dune)|the Scattering]], a great forced exodus of the former Imperium citizens to other galaxies and planets.

==Analysis==
In ''God Emperor of Dune'', Frank Herbert analyzes the cyclical patterns of human society, as well as humanity's evolutionary drives. Using his ancestral memories, Leto II has knowledge of the entirety of human history and is able to recall the effects  and patterns of tyrannical institutions, from the [[Babylonia]]n empire through to the [[Jesuits]] on ancient Earth, and thus builds an empire existing as a complete nexus encompassing all these methods. This [[galactic empire]] differs from the historical tyrants in that it is deliberately designed to end in destruction, and is only instituted in the first place as part of a plan to rescue humanity from an absolute destruction which Leto II has foreseen through his prescient visions. Leto II personally explores the emergent effects of civilization, noting that most hierarchical structures are remnants of evolutionary urges toward safety. Thus, by forming a perfectly safe and stable empire, Leto II delivers a message to be felt throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|surname=Touponce|given=William F.|year=1988|title=Frank Herbert|place=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Twayne Publishers imprint, G. K. Hall &amp; Co|isbn=0-8057-7514-5|id=PS3558.E63Z89}} &lt;!-- Part of Twayne's "United States authors series"; 136 pgs --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistically, the novel is permeated by quotations from, and speeches by its main character, Leto, to a degree unseen in any of the other ''Dune'' novels. The quotations are from Leto's own dictated records, made for future humanity. In part, this stylistic shift is an artifact of how Herbert wrote it: the first draft was written almost entirely in the [[Grammatical person|first-person]] narrative voice, only being revised in later drafts to insert more third-person narration of events.&lt;ref&gt;"''God Emperor of Dune'' is unique in the series, however, because almost all of the quotations are from ''The Stolen Journals'' (and not from the complete journals found at Dar-es-Balat). They were written by Leto to personalize himself to distant readers in the future....Written in the first person (the early drafts of ''God Emperor'' show that Herbert wrote most of the novel in the first person and left notes for himself to transcribe into the third person; material that he did not transcribe resulted in the journal quotations), they range informally and thought-provokingly over a broad range of subjects from government to prophecy to the nature of language...I believe this is their primary function, for Leto so dominates the book that the other characters seem to exist at times only to bring out differences in him. Even in their most private thoughts they are all obsessed with the God Emperor." pg 87, Touponce 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Heretics of Dune''''' is a 1984 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Frank Herbert]], the fifth in his [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' series]] of six novels. It was ranked as the No. 13 hardcover fiction best seller of 1984 by ''[[The New York Times]]''. 

Fifteen hundred years have passed since the 3,500-year reign of the God Emperor [[Leto II Atreides]] ended with his assassination; humanity is firmly on the [[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]], Leto's plan to save humanity from destruction.  By crushing the aspirations of humans for over three thousand years, Leto caused [[The Scattering (Dune)|the Scattering]], an explosion of humanity into the rest of the universe upon his death.  Now, some of those who went out into the universe are coming back, bent on conquest. Only the [[Bene Gesserit]] perceive the Golden Path and are therefore faced with a choice: keep to their traditional role of hidden manipulators who quietly ease tensions and guide human progress while struggling for their own survival, or embrace the Golden Path and push humanity onward into a new future where humans are free from the threat of extinction.

==Plot ==
Much has changed in the millennium and a half since the death of the [[Leto II Atreides|God Emperor]]. [[Sandworm (Dune)|Sandworms]] have reappeared on [[Arrakis]] (now called Rakis), each containing a fragment of the God Emperor's consciousness, and have renewed the flow of the all-important [[Melange (fictional drug)|spice melange]] to the galaxy. With Leto's death, the complex economic system built on spice collapsed, resulting in a period of famine followed by trillions of people leaving known space in a great Scattering. 

A new civilization has risen, with three dominant powers: the [[Ix (Dune)|Ixians]], whose [[no-ship]]s are capable of piloting between the stars and are invisible to outside detection; the [[Bene Tleilax]], who have learned to manufacture spice in their [[axlotl tank]]s and have created a new breed of [[Face Dancer]]s; and the Bene Gesserit, a [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] order of subtle political manipulators who possess [[superhuman]] abilities. However, people from the Scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers. The most powerful of these forces are the [[Honored Matres]], a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men.

On Rakis, a girl who can control the giant worms called [[Sheeana]] (later revealed to be a descendant of Siona from the previous novel) has been discovered. The Bene Gesserit intends to use a Tleilaxu-provided [[Duncan Idaho]] [[ghola]] to gain control of this sandrider, and the religious forces of humanity who they know will ultimately worship her. The Tleilaxu have altered the ghola to bring its physical reflexes up to modern standards. The Bene Gesserit leader, Mother Superior [[Taraza (Dune)|Taraza]], brings [[Miles Teg]] (also descended from Siona) to guard the new Idaho. Taraza also sends Reverend Mother [[Darwi Odrade]] to take command of the Bene Gesserit keep on Rakis. Odrade is a loose cannon; she does not obey normal Bene Gesserit prohibitions about love, and is also Teg's biological daughter. 

Bene Gesserit [[Imprinter (Dune)|Imprinter]] [[Lucilla (Dune)|Lucilla]] (yet another descendant of Siona's) is also sent by Taraza to bind Idaho's loyalty to the Sisterhood with her sexual talents. However, Lucilla must deal with Reverend Mother [[Schwangyu]], head of the ghola project but also the leader of a faction within the Bene Gesserit who feel the gholas are a danger. Above the planet [[Gammu (Dune)|Gammu]] (formerly known as Giedi Prime), Taraza is captured and held hostage by the Honored Matres aboard an Ixian no-ship. The [[Honored Matres]] insist Taraza invite Teg to the ship, hoping to gain control of the ghola project. Teg manages to turn the tables on the Matres, and rescues the Mother Superior and her party. 

An attack is then made on Sheeana on Rakis, which is prevented by the intervention of the Bene Gesserit. Odrade starts training Sheeana as a Bene Gesserit. At about the same time an attempt is made on the life of Idaho, but Teg is able to defeat it. Teg flees with Duncan and Lucilla into the countryside. In an ancient [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] [[no-globe]], Teg proceeds to awaken Idaho's original memories, but does so before Lucilla can imprint Duncan and thus tie him to the Sisterhood. 

In the meantime, Taraza has sent her trusted general Burzmali to search for Teg and his party, who finally establishes contact with Teg, his former mentor. During the operation, however, Teg and his companions are ambushed. Teg is captured while Lucilla and Duncan escape. Teg is tortured by a [[T-Probe]], but under pressure discovers new abilities: drastically increased physical capabilities and an uncertain type of prescience, which he uses to easily escape. At the same time, Idaho is ambushed and taken hostage. Taraza arranges a meeting with the [[Tleilaxu Master]] [[Tylwyth Waff|Waff]], who is soon forced to tell her what he knows about the Honored Matres. When pressed on the issue of Idaho, he also admits that the Bene Tleilax have conditioned their own agenda into him. 

As the meeting draws to a close, Taraza accidentally divines that Waff is a [[Zensunni]], giving the Bene Gesserit a lever to understand their ancient competitor. She and Odrade meet Waff again on Rakis. He tries to assassinate Taraza but Odrade convinces him that the Sisterhood shares the religious beliefs of the Bene Tleilax. Taraza offers full alliance with them against the onslaught of forces out of the Scattering. This agreement causes consternation among the Bene Gesserit, but Odrade realizes that Taraza's plan is to destroy Rakis. By destroying the planet, the Bene Gesserit would be dependent on the Tleilaxu for the spice, ensuring an alliance. 

Lucilla arrives at a Bene Gesserit safe house to discover it has been taken over by a young Honored Matre named [[Murbella]], who has partially subdued Idaho.  After being defeated in a quick bout of personal combat, Murbella assumes that Lucilla is the Great Honored Matre, and allows Lucilla and Burzmali to watch through the window of a locked room while she completes the sexual enslavement of the ghola.   However, hidden Tleilaxu conditioning kicks in, and Duncan responds with an equal technique, one that overwhelms Murbella; the experience restores in him the entire memories from all of the hundreds of previous Idaho gholas. Stunned and exhausted, Murbella dimly realizes that the man is the ghola they had been warned to search for, and unlocks the door to the room to gain Lucilla's assistance in killing him.  But Lucilla says, "We will kill no one.  This ghola goes to Rakis."

The Honored Matres attack Rakis, killing Taraza. Odrade becomes temporary leader of the Bene Gesserit before escaping with Sheeana into the desert on a worm. Teg also goes to a supposed safe house, only to discover the Honored Matres. He unleashes himself upon the complex, and finds that his prescient powers allow him to 'see' shielded no-ships; he captures one and locates Duncan and Lucilla. They are taken to Rakis with him and the now-hostage Murbella. When they arrive, Teg intercepts Odrade and Sheeana and their giant worm, having seen Taraza's master plan with his new vision. He loads them all up in his no-ship, finally leading his troops out on a last suicidal defense of Rakis, designed to attract the rage of the Honored Matres. 

The Honored Matres attack Rakis, destroying the planet and the sandworms {{mdash}} except for the one the Bene Gesserit escape with. They intend to drown the worm in a mixture of water and spice, turning it into [[sandtrout]] which will turn the secret Bene Gesserit planet [[Chapterhouse (Dune)|Chapterhouse]] into another Dune, but with the collective consciousness of the God Emperor diluted into just one sandworm, freeing humanity from the shadow of his prescience forever.

== Publication history ==
Frank Herbert wrote much of the initial draft of ''Heretics of Dune'' in Hawaii, using a [[Compaq]] word processor. According to his son Brian, Herbert's time spent writing the draft would be "exceedingly arduous and much slower for him [Herbert] than usual, because of all the time he had to spend out of his study tending to the medical crises of my mother, Beverly Herbert."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Herbert|first=Frank|title=Heretics of Dune|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|year=1987|isbn=9781440619649|pages=10|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Heretics of Dune'' was ranked as the No. 13 hardcover fiction best seller of 1984 by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/18/books/publishing-top-sellers-among-books-of-1984.html|title=Publishing: Top Sellers Among Books of 1984|last=McDowell|first=Edwin|date=January 18, 1985|work=[[The New York Times]]|via=NYTimes.com|access-date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chapterhouse: Dune''''' is a 1985 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Frank Herbert]], the last in his [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' series]] of six novels. It rose to No. 2 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].

A direct follow-up to ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', the novel chronicles the continued struggles of the [[Bene Gesserit]] Sisterhood against the violent [[Honored Matres]], who are succeeding in their bid to seize control of the universe and destroy the factions and planets that oppose them.

''Chapterhouse: Dune'' ends with a [[cliffhanger]], and Herbert's subsequent death in 1986 left some overarching plotlines of the series unresolved.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/books/review/Itzkoff.t.html|title=Across the Universe: ''Dune'' Babies|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=September 24, 2006|website=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024031606/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/books/review/Itzkoff.t.html|archive-date=October 24, 2015|url-status=live|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722083627/http://www.empmuseum.org/exhibitions/index.asp?articleID=939|encyclopedia=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]|date=1999|first1=John|last1=Clute|author-link1=John Clute|first2=Peter|last2=Nicholls|author-link2=Peter Nicholls (writer)|publisher=[[Orbit Books]]|title=Exhibitions – Science Fiction Hall of Fame – Frank Herbert|url=http://www.empmuseum.org/exhibitions/index.asp?articleID=939|archive-date=July 22, 2012|access-date=April 14, 2018|via=empmuseum.org|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFD 2007-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug07/sandwormsofdune.htm|title=Audiobook Review: ''Sandworms of Dune'' by Brian Herbert &amp; Kevin J Anderson|last=Snider|first=John C.|date=August 2007|publisher=SciFiDimensions.com (Internet Archive)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513064723/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug07/sandwormsofdune.htm|archive-date=May 13, 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two decades later, Herbert's son [[Brian Herbert]], along with [[Kevin J. Anderson]], published two [[sequel]]s – ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007) – based in part on notes left behind by Frank Herbert for what he referred to as ''Dune 7'', his own planned seventh novel in the ''Dune'' series.

==Plot==
The Bene Gesserit find themselves the target of the Honored Matres, whose conquest of the Old Empire is almost complete. The Matres are seeking to assimilate the technology and superhuman skills of the Bene Gesserit, and exterminate the Sisterhood itself. Now in command of the Bene Gesserit, Mother Superior [[Darwi Odrade]] continues to develop her drastic, secret plan to overcome the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit are also terraforming the planet [[Chapterhouse (Dune)|Chapterhouse]] to accommodate the all-important [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]], whose native planet [[Arrakis|Dune]] had been destroyed by the Matres.

[[Sheeana]], in charge of the project, expects sandworms to appear soon. The Honored Matres have also destroyed the entire [[Bene Tleilax]] civilization, with Tleilaxu Master [[Scytale (Dune)|Scytale]] the only one of his kind left alive. In Bene Gesserit captivity, Scytale possesses the Tleilaxu secret of [[ghola]] production, which he has reluctantly traded for the Sisterhood's protection. The first ghola produced is that of their recently deceased military genius, [[Miles Teg]]. The Bene Gesserit have two other prisoners on Chapterhouse: the latest [[Duncan Idaho]] ghola, and former Honored Matre [[Murbella]], whom they have accepted as a novice despite their suspicion that she intends to escape back to the Honored Matres.

Lampadas, a center for Bene Gesserit education, has been destroyed by the Honored Matres. The planet's Chancellor, [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Lucilla (Dune)|Lucilla]], manages to escape carrying the shared-minds of millions of Reverend Mothers. Lucilla is forced to land on [[Giedi Prime|Gammu]] where she seeks refuge with an underground group of [[Jews]]. The Rabbi gives Lucilla sanctuary, but to save his people from the Matres he must deliver her to them. Before doing so, he reveals [[Rebecca (Dune)|Rebecca]], a "wild" Reverend Mother who has gained her [[Other Memory]] without Bene Gesserit training.

Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca, who promises to take the memories of Lampadas safely back to the Sisterhood. Lucilla is then "betrayed", and taken before the [[Great Honored Matre]] [[Dama (Dune)|Dama]], who tries to persuade her to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. The Honored Matres are particularly interested in learning to voluntarily modify their body chemistry, a skill that atrophied among the Bene Gesserit who went out into the Scattering and evolved into the Honored Matres. From this, Lucilla deduces that the greater enemy that the Matres are fleeing from is making extensive use of biological warfare. Lucilla refuses to share this knowledge with the Matres, and Dama ultimately kills her.

Back on Chapterhouse, Odrade confronts Duncan and forces him to admit that he is a [[Mentat]], proving that he retains the memories of his many ghola lives. Meanwhile, Murbella collapses under the pressure of Bene Gesserit training, and realizes that she wants to be Bene Gesserit. Odrade believes that the Sisterhood made a mistake in fearing emotion, and that in order to evolve, they must learn to accept emotions. Murbella survives the [[spice agony]] and becomes a Reverend Mother. Odrade confronts Sheeana, discovering that Duncan and Sheeana have been allies for some time. Sheeana does not reveal that they have been considering the option of reawakening Teg's memory through [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]], nor does Odrade discover that Sheeana has the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison.

Teg is awakened by Sheeana using imprinting techniques. Odrade appoints him again as [[Bashar (Dune)|Bashar]] of the military forces of the Sisterhood for the assault on the Honored Matres. Odrade announces to the Bene Gesserit that Teg will lead an attack against the Honored Matres. She also makes clear her intention to share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana, making them candidates to succeed her as Mother Superior if she dies. Odrade meets with the Great Honored Matre while the Bene Gesserit forces under Teg attack Gammu with tremendous force. Teg uses his secret ability to see no-ships to secure control of the system, and victory for the Bene Gesserit seems inevitable. In the midst of this battle, Rebecca and the Jews take refuge with the Bene Gesserit fleet.

Dama's chief advisor [[Logno]] assassinates Dama with poison and assumes control of the Honored Matres. Too late, Odrade and Teg realize they have fallen into a trap, and the Honored Matres use a mysterious weapon to turn defeat into victory, and capture Odrade. Murbella saves as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she can and they withdraw to Chapterhouse. Odrade, however, had planned for the possible failure of the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface, announcing herself as an Honored Matre who, in the confusion, has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives on the planet and is taken to the Great Honored Matre. Unable to control her anger, Logno attacks but is killed by Murbella.

Awed by her physical prowess, the remaining Honored Matres are forced to accept her as their new leader. Odrade is also killed in the melee and Murbella shares with Odrade to absorb her newest memories, as they had already shared prior to the battle. Murbella's ascension to leadership is not accepted as victory by all the Bene Gesserit. Some flee Chapterhouse, notably Sheeana, who has a vision of her own, and arranges to have some of the new worms that have emerged in the Chapterhouse desert brought aboard the no-ship. Sheeana is joined by Duncan. The two escape in the giant no-ship, with Scytale, Teg and the Jews. Murbella recognizes their plan at the last minute, but is powerless to stop them.

==Reception==
''Chapterhouse: Dune'' debuted at No. 5 and rose to No. 2 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/19/books/best-sellers.html?scp=6&amp;sq=chapterhouse%20dune&amp;st=cse|title=Best Sellers|date=May 19, 1985|work=[[The New York Times]]|via=NYTimes.com|access-date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Jonas of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that "Against all odds, the universe of ''Dune'' keeps getting richer in texture, more challenging in its moral dilemmas."&lt;ref name="NYT 1985"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/books/science-fiction.html?scp=3&amp;sq=chapterhouse%20dune&amp;st=cse|title=Science Fiction (Review)|last=Jonas|first=Gerald|date=June 16, 1985|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Langford|Dave Langford]] reviewed the novel for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #65, and stated that "The hyper-acute characters are impressive, the resolution thoughtful and humane.

'''''Dune''''' (titled onscreen as '''''Dune: Part One''''') is a 2021 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[science fiction film]] directed and co-produced by [[Denis Villeneuve]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[Eric Roth]]. It is the first of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel [[Dune (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Frank Herbert]]. Set in the distant future, the film follows [[Paul Atreides]] as his family, the noble [[House Atreides]], is thrust into a war for the deadly and inhospitable desert planet [[Arrakis]]. The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Timothée Chalamet]], [[Rebecca Ferguson]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Stellan Skarsgård]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Stephen McKinley Henderson]], [[Zendaya]], [[Chang Chen]], [[Sharon Duncan-Brewster]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[Jason Momoa]], and [[Javier Bardem]].

The film is the third adaptation of ''Dune,'' following [[David Lynch]]'s [[Dune (1984 film)|1984 film]] and [[John Harrison (director)|John Harrison]]'s [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 television miniseries]]. After an unsuccessful attempt by [[Paramount Pictures]] to produce a new adaptation, [[Legendary Pictures]] acquired the ''Dune'' film and television rights in 2016, with Villeneuve signing on as director in February 2017. Production contracts were secured only for the first film, relying on its success before a sequel would be produced. [[Principal photography]] took place from March to July 2019 at locations including [[Budapest]], [[Jordan]], [[Norway]], and [[Abu Dhabi]].

''Dune'' was scheduled for a late 2020 release but was delayed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The film premiered at the [[78th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 3, 2021, before its international release on September 15; it was then released in United States theaters and streaming on [[HBO Max]] on October 22. ''Dune'' was a box office success, grossing almost $435 million on a $165 million budget, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2021. It was well received by critics and audiences with praise for Villeneuve's direction, screenplay, the visual effects, ambition, costume design, [[Hans Zimmer]]'s musical score, cinematography, and faithfulness to the source material. The film won six awards at the [[94th Academy Awards]] and was nominated in four other categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], in addition to receiving [[List of accolades received by Dune (2021 film)|numerous other accolades]]. A sequel, ''[[Dune: Part Two]]'', was released in March 2024.

In the &lt;!-- This wording was agreed upon on the talk page. Please do not change without consensus. --&gt;distant future&lt;!-- This wording was agreed upon on the talk page. Please do not change without consensus. --&gt;, Duke [[Leto I Atreides|Leto Atreides]], ruler of the planet Caladan, is assigned by the [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam IV]] to replace Baron [[Vladimir Harkonnen]] as the [[fiefholder]] of [[Arrakis]], a harsh [[desert planet]] and sole source of "[[Melange (fictional drug)|spice]]", a valuable psychotropic substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness. Spice is key to [[interstellar travel]], giving [[Spacing Guild]] Navigators the ability to guide [[starships]] to traverse space instantaneously and safely. Shaddam plots for House Harkonnen to retake Arrakis, secretly aided by his [[Sardaukar]] troops, and destroy House Atreides. Leto is suspicious of the Emperor but weighs the risks against the power of controlling Arrakis and making an alliance with its mysterious natives, the [[Fremen]].

Leto's [[Concubinage|concubine]], [[Lady Jessica]], is an acolyte of the [[Bene Gesserit]], an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of their centuries-long [[Bene Gesserit breeding program|breeding program]], they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the Kwisatz Haderach, a Bene Gesserit and [[Messiah|messianic]] superbeing with the [[clairvoyance]] necessary to guide humanity to a better future. She disobeyed and bore a son, [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], who is trained by Leto's aides, [[Duncan Idaho]], [[Gurney Halleck]], the [[Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]], and the [[Mentat]] [[Thufir Hawat]]; Jessica teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan of his troubling visions of the future. The Reverend Mother and Imperial [[Truthsayer]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] visits Caladan and subjects him to a death-alternative [[gom jabbar]] test to assess his humanity and impulse control, which he passes. At a secret meeting on Giedi Prime, Mohiam insists Baron Harkonnen spare Paul and Jessica in his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees.

House Atreides arrives at [[Arrakeen]], the fortress stronghold on Arrakis. Duncan's advance party has made contact with the Fremen. The natives revere Paul and Jessica, which Jessica explains is due to the Bene Gesserit [[Missionaria Protectiva|sowing beliefs]] on Arrakis centuries earlier. Leto negotiates with Fremen chieftain [[Stilgar]] and meets the Imperial [[Judge of the Change]], Dr. [[Liet-Kynes|Kynes]], a [[Planetary science|planetologist]] who lives among the Fremen. Kynes briefs them on the dangers of spice harvesting, and the giant [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]s which travel under the desert and make the use of protective [[Holtzman shield]]s unwise. During a flight, they dramatically rescue a stranded spice-harvesting crew from a sandworm, and Paul's exposure to the spice triggers intense premonitions.

An attempt to assassinate Paul with a [[hunter-seeker]] fails. Yueh betrays the Atreides and disables Arrakeen's shields, allowing the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to invade. He incapacitates Leto, planning to exchange him for his wife, who is the Baron's prisoner. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule with which the Duke can assassinate the Baron. After the Baron double-crosses and murders Yueh, Leto releases the gas, killing himself and the Baron's Mentat, [[Piter De Vries]], but the Baron survives. Though the Baron has arranged to have Paul and Jessica dropped deep in the desert to die, a compassionate Yueh has left them with a [[fremkit]] with survival supplies. Jessica uses a Bene Gesserit technique called "[[The Voice (Dune)|the Voice]]" to overpower and kill their captors. Overnighting in the desert, Paul—surrounded by spice—has visions of a bloody [[Religious war|holy war]] fought across the universe in his name.

Baron Harkonnen gives command of the conquered Arrakis to his nephew, [[Glossu Rabban|Rabban]], and orders him to restart spice production to recoup the cost of the invasion. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and Kynes, and Paul discloses his plan to marry one of Shaddam's daughters to avert the civil war that would ensue from news of the Emperor's treachery. They are found by the Sardaukar who have a [[lasgun]], but Duncan sacrifices himself to enable Paul and Jessica to escape; Kynes is mortally wounded and lures a sandworm to devour her and the Sardaukar. In the deep desert, Paul and Jessica encounter Stilgar's tribe, including [[Chani (character)|Chani]], the young woman in Paul's visions. Fremen warrior Jamis opposes Stilgar's lenience to them and challenges Paul to a ritual duel to the death, which Paul wins. Against Jessica's wishes, Paul joins the Fremen to fulfill his father's goal of allying with them to bring peace to Arrakis.

===Background===
{{See also|Dune (novel)#Adaptations|l1=''Dune'' (novel) § Adaptations|Dune (franchise)|l2=''Dune'' (franchise)}}

Following the publication of [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' in 1965, it was identified for potential film prospects and the rights to adapt the novel to film have been held by several producers since 1971. Attempts to make an adaptation based on the book were considered to be "unfilmable" due to its breadth of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 9, 2017 |title=Looking Back at All the Utterly Disastrous Attempts to Adapt ''Dune'' |url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/looking-back-at-all-the-utterly-disastrous-attempts-to-adapt-dune.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421075009/https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/looking-back-at-all-the-utterly-disastrous-attempts-to-adapt-dune.html |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 19, 2020 |website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Child |first=Ben |date=April 10, 2020 |title=Can Denis Villeneuve break the curse of Frank Herbert's ''Dune'' on the big screen? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/10/can-denis-villeneuve-break-the-curse-of-frank-herbert-dune-on-the-big-screen |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200418091626/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/10/can-denis-villeneuve-break-the-curse-of-frank-herbert-dune-on-the-big-screen |archive-date=April 18, 2020 |access-date=April 19, 2020 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=September 28, 2021 |title=Spice World: WIRED Traces the Dune Legacy |url=https://www.wired.com/story/the-dune-legacy/ |access-date=September 28, 2021 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |archive-date=September 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928110756/https://www.wired.com/story/the-dune-legacy/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's status among fans meant that deviations without strong justification could potentially harm the film's reputation.&lt;ref name="guardian aug21"&gt;{{cite web |last=Child |first=Ben |date=August 27, 2021 |title=Will Denis Villeneuve's Dune finally succeed where others failed? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/27/denis-villeneuve-dune-david-lynch-alejandro-jodorowsky |access-date=September 28, 2021 |website=[[The Guardian]] |archive-date=September 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210927190939/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/27/denis-villeneuve-dune-david-lynch-alejandro-jodorowsky |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] acquired the rights in the 1970s to make a fourteen-hour adaptation of the book, but the project ultimately failed to secure sufficient funds.

In adapting the book for a contemporary audience, Villeneuve wanted to reflect on realities that have happened since that time related to contemporary over-exploitation of the Earth, and he considered his screenplay "a [[coming-of-age story]], but also a call for action for the youth".&lt;ref name="vf firstlook" /&gt; In doing so, Villeneuve wanted to recreate the experience he had felt when he initially read the book as a teen.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Chacksfield |first=Marc |date=October 19, 2021 |title=Director Denis Villeneuve on the making of Dune |url=https://www.shortlist.com/news/director-denis-villeneuve-on-the-making-of-dune-402945 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211019140342/https://www.shortlist.com/news/director-denis-villeneuve-on-the-making-of-dune-402945 |archive-date=October 19, 2021 |access-date=February 13, 2024 |website=[[ShortList]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He streamlined many parts of the novel for the film, and wanted to keep "the atmosphere and poetry of the book intact".&lt;ref name="latimes changes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rottenberg |first=Josh |date=October 21, 2021 |title=Why 'Dune' made these 5 key changes from Frank Herbert's book |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-10-21/dune-movie-book-changes-explained-denis-villeneuve |access-date=October 21, 2021 |website=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |archive-date=October 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211022021200/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-10-21/dune-movie-book-changes-explained-denis-villeneuve |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included eliminating internal monologues and epigraphs used in the book and simplifying the "pseudo-antiquated" dialogue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Instead, he focused the story around Paul and Jessica, giving them a secret hand gesture language they could use to communicate silently to each other. The film also minimizes many of the aspects around the Emperor and the politics surrounding the Imperium, as he believed he could keep the scope of the novel and its exploration of how power is used, while still keeping the focus on Paul's coming-of-age story.&lt;ref name="latimes changes" /&gt; The inclusion of film books was adapted from the book, with Villeneuve wanting it to convey Paul's "appetite for learning" and his desire to learn about the Arrakis and Fremen culture.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Some characters were given less prominence, such as Baron Harkonnen, members of his court, and the Mentats Thufir Hawat and Piter De Vries, but established enough so that they can be used in the future.&lt;ref name="latimes changes" /&gt; He wanted to depict the Baron as a complex antagonist rather than as a caricature, feeling the novel presented him as being the latter, and took inspiration from [[Colonel Kurtz]].&lt;ref name="vf firstlook" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Another major change was altering some of the arcs of the female characters in the book to give them more respect and prominence, as Villeneuve felt femininity was a crucial theme in the book.&lt;ref name="latimes changes" /&gt; According to Rebecca Ferguson, "Denis was very respectful of Frank's work in the book, [but] the quality of the arcs for [many] of the women have been brought up to a new level. There were some shifts he did, and they are beautifully portrayed now."&lt;ref name="vf firstlook" /&gt; Lady Jessica was given an expanded role as a soldier and member of the Bene Gesserit. As such, the studio labeled this role a "warrior priestess", in contrast to the joking label of "space nun" that Villeneuve felt was implied by the book.&lt;ref name="vf firstlook" /&gt;

=== Design ===
==== Set and props ====
The set design for the film was done by production designer [[Patrice Vermette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grobar |first=Matt |date=March 27, 2022 |title='Dune' Production Designer Patrice Vermette Pays Tribute To Late Jean-Marc Vallée In Oscar Speech |url=https://deadline.com/2022/03/patrice-vermette-zsuzsanna-sipos-2022-oscars-best-production-design-1234987200/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220327233652/https://deadline.com/2022/03/patrice-vermette-zsuzsanna-sipos-2022-oscars-best-production-design-1234987200/ |archive-date=March 27, 2022 |access-date=May 11, 2022 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermette stated that the set design for ''Dune'' would be guided by the need "to ground the story into realistic settings to help the audience believe in the extraordinary elements". He sought to make the sets as realistic and immersive as possible, using minimal set extensions and no greenscreens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vermette |first=Patrice |author-link=Patrice Vermette |date=October 21, 2021 |title=Dune Production Designer Patrice Vermette on Creating the Film's Expansive Juxtaposed Worlds |url=https://www.moviemaker.com/dune-production-designer-patrice-vermette-denis-villeneuve/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211022113941/https://www.moviemaker.com/dune-production-designer-patrice-vermette-denis-villeneuve/ |archive-date=October 22, 2021 |access-date=May 11, 2022 |website=[[MovieMaker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the creation of any sets or visual effects, Villeneuve and a group of specific people, including his storyboard artist and later concept artist Deak Ferrand, worked together to define the visual language for the film.

Vermette created a "visual bible" to guide the development of the set design and to keep it consistent with the visual effects design used throughout the film and eventually later "came on board to extrapolate the world". He also re-read the novel, as he felt that "the book gives a lot of clues or cues that will help you navigate it to design things, but it's quite nonspecific", adding that he wanted to support Villeneuve's original vision of the novel when he read it as a young teenager, and base the design around Herbert's original novel. The team's early [[mood board]]s for the visual language of the film consisted of a variety of images, including [[ziggurat]] architecture from [[Mesopotamia]], Egyptian references, bunkers from [[World War II]], [[brutalist architecture]] from Brazil and the Soviet Union, megastructures conceived by [[Superstudio]], marble mines, power dams, and imagery of glaciers taking over mountains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web |last=Welk |first=Brian |date=January 11, 2022 |title=Why 'Dune' Production Designers Built a 'Visual Bible' Before Day One of Shooting |url=https://www.thewrap.com/dune-production-design-visual-bible/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220111190700/https://www.thewrap.com/dune-production-design-visual-bible/ |archive-date=January 11, 2022 |access-date=May 11, 2022 |website=[[TheWrap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The design for the ornithopters was conceived by Villeneuve and storyboard artist Sam Hudecki. Villeneuve wanted the ornithopter be "muscular"; he wanted it to resemble a dragonfly and helicopter, but also appear realistic, such as through "obey[ing] the laws of nature, gravity, and physics". This fit in with his overall perception of the ''Dune'' world being [[Retrofuturism|retro-futuristic]] and analog. He wanted his team to design the cockpits in a way so that it allowed the actors to "always be in visual contact with the landscape". Two function ornithopter models, 48- and 75-feet long, were created for filming by London propmakers, with operable doors and interior cockpit areas. They weighed over 11 tons and required an [[Antonov]] cargo plane to transport them to filming locations in Hungary and Jordan. One ornithopter used in filming, nicknamed "The Bucket", had customizable pieces allowing for more space. Cranes were used to make the models fly, such as during a scene in which Paul and Gurney watch a sandworm consume a spice harvester. He added that though it was difficult to use ornithopters for filming, he felt it was "quite rewarding to see them in position".&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cardy |first=Simon |date=October 28, 2021 |title=Dune: How Denis Villeneuve Designed the Ornithopters |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-how-denis-villeneuve-designed-the-ornithopters |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028140308/https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-how-denis-villeneuve-designed-the-ornithopters |archive-date=October 28, 2021 |access-date=May 13, 2022 |website=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many practical sets were created on the soundstages and backlots of the Origo Film Studios in [[Budapest]], Hungary, which served as interiors for the three planets. In the design for Caladan, Vermette sought to give the planet "a feeling of melancholia". He wanted Caladan to resemble autumn in Canada, his home country, as he thought that it represented "the end of a cycle... or the beginning of a new one". He identified "dramatic coastal mountain ranges" and forests containing Norwegian pines as defining features of the planet.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Meanwhile, the interior sets of Caladan were inspired by medieval Japanese aesthetics, particularly that of Paul's training room, containing intricate screens and diffused lighting. Props were created by set decorator Richard Roberts, including custom-made furniture, lighting, textiles produced in Denmark, and other items designed to look antique.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fixsen |first=Anna |date=October 28, 2021 |title=How Production Designer Patrice Vermette Created The Epic Look of 'Dune' |url=https://www.elledecor.com/life-culture/a38066050/dune-set-design/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028223445/https://www.elledecor.com/life-culture/a38066050/dune-set-design/ |archive-date=October 28, 2021 |access-date=May 12, 2022 |website=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original design for the sandworm was deemed "prehistoric", inspired by whales with [[baleen]] in their mouths.&lt;ref name="wired sfx" /&gt; The sandworm's skin texture was based on tree bark and mud flats. Vermette spoke of the challenges involved in creating the set designs used for the sandworms, stating "It was a creature that commanded respect, and it’s almost seen as a deity in the world of the Fremen. So that’s why the first time you see the depiction of the sand worm on the mural, it’s presented with sun coming out of its mouth".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Giardina |first1=Carolyn |last2=Dresden |first2=Hilton |date=March 16, 2022 |title=How 'Dune', 'West Side Story' and More Production Designers Brought a Sense of Time and Place to Their Oscar-Nominated Films |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/oscars-dune-west-side-story-production-design/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220317081508/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/oscars-dune-west-side-story-production-design/ |archive-date=March 17, 2022 |access-date=May 11, 2022 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design for Arrakeen was influenced by the book's description of Arrakis's climate, with Vermette calling it "the biggest residency ever built by humankind" and "a response as a colonial entity that took over the planet for the exploitation of ... spice". He designed the city in a "rock bowl" shape to protect its infrastructure from sandworms, and the buildings at an angle to protect them against high wind speeds. He also made their walls thick, as it made the interiors cooler. The team was inspired by WWII bunkers, bunkers, [[Maya architecture|Mayan temples]], and Brazilian modernism. The history and culture of the Fremen was also indicated through various murals throughout the residence, compared to that of a church, saying "I thought maybe they had created murals telling the story of the colonizing of the planet — but those would probably have been created by Fremen artists."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garbutt |first=Emily |date=January 21, 2022 |title=Dune production designer and cinematographer on bringing Denis Villeneuve's vision to life |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/dune-production-designer-and-cinematographer-on-bringing-denis-villeneuves-vision-to-life/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220121111207/https://www.gamesradar.com/dune-production-designer-and-cinematographer-on-bringing-denis-villeneuves-vision-to-life/ |archive-date=January 21, 2022 |access-date=May 11, 2022 |website=[[GamesRadar+]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; One practical set was the environmental lab in which Sardaukar soldiers descend from the air.

==== Costumes ====
Over 1000 looks for Arrakis, Caladan and Giedi Prime were designed by the team for the film.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The costume design for the film was done by [[Jacqueline West]] and [[Bob Morgan (costume designer)|Bob Morgan]].

Her design was primarily inspired by the [[Middle Ages]], and what she envisioned it would look like in the future, using the term "mod-eval" to describe her approach to designing the costumes. She found similarities between the Fremen and the [[French Resistance]] and called the Sardaukar the "[[Nazism|Nazis]] of this universe". Additionally, she took inspiration from various painters, including [[Giotto]], [[Francisco Goya]], and [[Caravaggio]], and British art historian [[John Berger]]. She also took cues from the fashion of [[Balenciaga]], and the [[Bedouin]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] people.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web |last=Horst |first=Carole |date=September 17, 2021 |title='Dune' Costume Designers Break Down the Construction of Stillsuits and Each Planet's Unique Look |url=https://variety.com/2021/artisans/design/dune-costume-design-stillsuits-denis-villeneuve-1235066832/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210917170225/https://variety.com/2021/artisans/design/dune-costume-design-stillsuits-denis-villeneuve-1235066832/ |archive-date=September 17, 2021 |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spacing Guild was based on the [[Avignon Papacy]], as West had connected their persecution of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] to that of House Atreides, considering House Atreides "was betrayed by the Emperor and his people". She used reference pictures of medieval popes and modernized it when designing their costumes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Bene Gesserit sorceresses' costumes were based on [[Tarot|tarot cards]] and [[chess piece]]s, while the Harkonnen's armors was designed to resemble a bug's shell, using books containing "medieval drawings of insects, spiders, ants, praying mantises and lizards" as reference.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web |last=Welk |first=Brian |date=January 11, 2022 |title='Dune' Costume Designers Were Inspired by Everything From Balenciaga to Tarot Cards to Insects |url=https://www.thewrap.com/dune-costume-designers-jacqueline-west-bob-morgan/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220111181621/https://www.thewrap.com/dune-costume-designers-jacqueline-west-bob-morgan/ |archive-date=January 11, 2022 |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=[[TheWrap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design for the Atreides's costumes was based on the [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]], as she felt "it was the end of an empire" and described their costumes as having a "simplicity ... that was regal".&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |date=March 15, 2022 |title=How Dune's Futuristic Costumes Drew Upon the Ancient Past |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/03/awards-insider-dune-movie-costume-design |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220315150456/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/03/awards-insider-dune-movie-costume-design |archive-date=March 15, 2022 |access-date=May 9, 2022 |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, she based Lady Jessica's dresses in the first half of the film on the works of [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]], while the turmeric-toned gown she wears while landing on Arrakis was influenced by Middle Eastern clothing and paintings of women in North Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

West used the [[David Lean]]'s films ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) and ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965), in addition to ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1966) to further inspire the diversity of costumes. She also researched Roman and Greek mythology, feeling that it connected to House Atreides and House Harkonnen and characterized as being similar to a "real Greek and Roman tragedy on one level". She dyed the [[gauze]] for the Fremen in desert colors, inspired by the color of sand and rocks in the Jordan filming locations, as she felt it highlighted the movement and shapes of people's bodies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A prototype for the stillsuit was designed by West and Jose Fernandez at Ironhead Studios in Los Angeles. Morgan then took Fernandez's prototype and set up a factory in an airplane hangar at Origo Studios, where additional suits were designed within two weeks. He hired artisans across Europe who created concept designs and over 150 individual pieces for the suits. Over 250 stillsuits were used when filming in Jordan. The suits were designed so that they were flexible and could fit the actor's body, while also remaining accurate to the novel. They created "micro-sandwiches" of acrylic fibers and porous cottons, which absorbed the moisture and allowed the actors to remain cool inside the suits. Tubing also ran through the micro-sandwiches for increased flexibility. Zippers and buttons were not used as they were deemed "archaic".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert used "sandscreens" for filming scenes in Arrakis and Arrakeen; instead of using [[Green screen|green-based backgrounds]], the visual effects team used sand-colored ones that matched the establishing desert shots intended for backgrounds. The sandscreens were used in capturing scenes of the ornithopter, with the VFX team using the helicopter footage and replacing them with the actual ornithopter models. This made the sand displacement, such as when it lands and takes off, easier to capture. This was also filmed by encapsulating the ornithopter models in a black box with fans blowing dust around. The wings were inserted using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired sfx"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Watercutter |first=Angela |date=October 25, 2021 |title=How Dune's VFX and Sound Teams Made Sandworms From Scratch |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dune-sandworm-vfx/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025111143/https://www.wired.com/story/dune-sandworm-vfx/ |archive-date=October 25, 2021 |access-date=October 25, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndieWire"&gt;{{cite web |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |date=November 5, 2021 |title='Dune': How Denis Villeneuve's VFX Team Created Desert Power for the Sandworms and Ornithopters |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2021/11/dune-denis-villeneuves-vfx-sandworms-ornithopters-1234676083/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105222623/https://www.indiewire.com/2021/11/dune-denis-villeneuves-vfx-sandworms-ornithopters-1234676083/ |archive-date=November 5, 2021 |access-date=April 17, 2022 |website=[[IndieWire]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar processes were used to film scenes in Caladan, such as by creating "grayscreens" and those with a "slight blue tint" for filming interior and exterior scenes, respectively. Bluescreens were used for Salusa Secundus scenes. He clarified that different colored screens were used based on the imagery of the foreground and background, which made compositing them together easier.

The sandworms were created through CGI. The VFX team found a lot of difficulty in deciding how the sandworm would move. The team spent over a year in figuring out the movements of the sandworm, and researched the body movements of various animals, such as worms and snakes. The sand ripples created by the worms were inspired by [[Jaws (film)|''Jaws'']] (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Rebecca |date=March 21, 2022 |title=Dune's Oscar-Nominated Artists Reveal How to Build a Sandworm |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/03/awards-insider-dune-how-to-build-a-sandworm |url-access=limited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220321191711/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/03/awards-insider-dune-how-to-build-a-sandworm |archive-date=March 21, 2022 |access-date=April 17, 2022 |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special-effects supervisor [[Gerd Nefzer]] designed a vibrating 8x8 foot steel plate and placed it under the sand. This resulted in the formation of various patterns, used to signify an approaching sandworm. The vibrating areas were also later enhanced to cover a larger area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web |last=Failes |first=Ian |date=November 5, 2021 |title=The 'Dune' visual effects team used sandscreens instead of bluescreens |url=https://beforesandafters.com/2021/11/06/the-dune-visual-effects-team-used-sandscreens-instead-of-bluescreens/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105210412/https://beforesandafters.com/2021/11/06/the-dune-visual-effects-team-used-sandscreens-instead-of-bluescreens/ |archive-date=November 5, 2021 |access-date=April 14, 2022 |website=befores &amp; afters |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team initially considered using rigged explosives to capture the motion of the sandworms breaking the surface in the desert, but rejected the idea as this was impractical to perform in the Middle East. Instead, they used the [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]] software to have sand emulate the motion of water. Villeneuve did not want the associated sound design to appear as a studio production. Sound designers Mark Mangini and Theo Green used a "fake documentary realism" approach to capture natural sounds and manipulate them for use in the film, such as recording the sounds of shifting sands in [[Death Valley]] using [[hydrophone]]s.&lt;ref name="wired sfx" /&gt;

The [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]] facilities of DNEG were used for the Arrakeen invasion sequence. It involved the combination of practical and digital effects. The VFX supervisor of the Montreal team, Brian Connor, created a digital Arrakeen space port, while the Vancouver team was tasked with simulating the explosions. Practical explosions filmed in the Budapest backlots were later enhanced by the VFX team, as the special effects team had rigs of practical light shining through the fog from the practical explosions. This allowed the VFX team to then blend the practical and digital shots together easier.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Lambert created the visual effects for the shields by combining past and future frames after experimenting with a clip from ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954), which resulted in a "shimmering" look Villeneuve approved. They also added colors; they used blue for when an object bounces and red for when it penetrates. The scene of Paul's future vision was filmed using [[Motion capture|motion-capture]] (mo-cap), and the team replicated the mo-cap to add hundreds of fighters to the scene. Animation supervisor Robyn Luckham helped create the scene as the team didn't know much about mo-cap. They also added explosions in the foreground, sandworms in the background, sand displacement throughout the scenes, and used more simulations to render the scene in real-time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To create the desert mouse, Muad'Dib, the team created a detailed practical stuffy model, and filmed it in Jordan for the appropriate desert lighting. The animation team used footage of animals idling as reference, and animated the mouse so that it "only expends effort when absolutely necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 9, 2022 |title=Dune: Making of the CG Desert Mouse |url=https://www.isotropix.com/learn/customer-stories/dune-making-of-the-cg-desert-mouse |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220418051030/https://www.isotropix.com/learn/customer-stories/dune-making-of-the-cg-desert-mouse |archive-date=April 18, 2022 |access-date=April 18, 2022 |website=Isotropix |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]] hologram in the film was created by projecting different "slices" of the light on Chalamet's face during plate photography based on his position on the set using a [[projector]]. Wylie then completed the scene by adding the hologram around him. For the hunter-seeker, the team used a stick on set as reference, and later replaced it with the proper models via CGI. Practical rigs were attached to Skarsgård's body to create the illusion of the Baron's levitation. Sometimes, the levitation was done practically with a seesaw rig. However, the suspensor device attached to his back was inserted using CGI.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogg |first=Trevor |date=November 15, 2021 |title=Practical and Digital Effects Expertly Join Forces on 'Dune' |url=https://www.awn.com/vfxworld/practical-and-digital-effects-expertly-join-forces-dune |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211116000329/https://www.awn.com/vfxworld/practical-and-digital-effects-expertly-join-forces-dune |archive-date=November 16, 2021 |access-date=April 18, 2022 |website=[[Animation World Network]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Zimmer]] affirmed he would be scoring ''Dune'' near the start of the film's production in March 2019.&lt;ref name="filming start" /&gt; Zimmer had previously worked with Villeneuve on ''Blade Runner 2049''. At the time, Zimmer had been approached by [[Christopher Nolan]] for composing on his then-upcoming film ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]'', but Zimmer opted for ''Dune'', citing his personal love for the book as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barfield |first=Charles |date=July 16, 2019 |title=Hans Zimmer Explains Why He Chose 'Dune' Over Christopher Nolan's Latest &amp; Says He Never Saw The David Lynch 1984 Film |url=https://theplaylist.net/hans-zimmer-dune-christopher-nolan-20190716/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717140707/https://theplaylist.net/hans-zimmer-dune-christopher-nolan-20190716/ |archive-date=July 17, 2019 |access-date=August 30, 2019 |website=[[The Playlist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmer did not want the soundtrack to sound like his previous works and used instruments atypical of a Western orchestra, an approach he called "anti-groove".&lt;ref name="nytimes zimmer oct21" /&gt; He avoided watching Lynch's ''Dune'' so as not to be influenced by [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s music, instead spending a week in a desert in Utah to incorporate its sounds into the score. The music was performed using an eclectic set of instruments, including some that were created specifically for the soundtrack. Performers for the score include guitarist [[Guthrie Govan]] and vocalist [[Loire (musician)|Loire Cotler]].

For the first ''Dune'' trailer, Zimmer supervised a 32-person choir via [[FaceTime]] (necessitated by pandemic restrictions) for the recording of a cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s song "[[Eclipse (Pink Floyd song)|Eclipse]]".

However, he felt that the "emotional strings" were not very impactful to him.&lt;ref name="Review" /&gt; Brooks agreed with the sentiment that it was a high-quality blockbuster film and found it "the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse", citing the worldbuilding, ensemble cast, and [[set piece]]s as positive elements.&lt;ref name="dizzying" /&gt; Collins also praised the writing and Chalamet and Ferguson's performances, feeling the exposition was written well. However, he highlighted the production design and the sandworms, calling the latter "threateningly alien, but also enticing, even addictive" and commenting "the sets ring with the desolate grandeur of ancient ruins".&lt;ref name="unsettling" /&gt;

In a positive yet more critical review, [[Justin Chang]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt the film used thematic elements from the novel well, and also lauded the production values albeit labelling the visual aesthetic as [[Monochrome|monochromatic]]. Chang further went on to praise the plot for increasing the role of women in the story and tension regarding anticipation of action sequences, which he thought were directed well. However, he disliked the "abrupt, unsatisfying" ending and wanted Villeneuve's style to align with [[David Lynch]]'s style, which he considered to contain "feverish, pustular imagery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chang |first=Justin |author-link=Justin Chang |date=September 3, 2021 |title=Review: Denis Villeneuve's 'Dune' is a transporting vision, but it could use a touch more madness |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-09-03/dune-review-denis-villeneuve-frank-herbert |url-access=limited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210921043233/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-09-03/dune-review-denis-villeneuve-frank-herbert |archive-date=September 21, 2021 |access-date=September 6, 2021 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', who graded the film a B, wrote that ''Dune'' had little exposition and also appreciated the worldbuilding and visual aesthetic.

However, while she felt Villeneuve had attempted to be faithful to the source material, she also opined that Villeneuve was trying to satisfy the demands of the contemporary film industry. Her major issues were also with the ending and what she deemed to be a "white man leading a fateful charge", though she refrained from labelling it a [[White savior narrative in film|white savior narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dargis |first=Manohla |date=October 20, 2021 |title='Dune' Review: A Hero in the Making, on Shifting Sands |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/movies/dune-review.html |url-access=limited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211020230013/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/movies/dune-review.html |archive-date=October 20, 2021 |access-date=August 10, 2023 |website=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Owen Gleiberman]]'s review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was more negative: he appreciated the film's extensive focus on worldbuilding, but felt it had also undermined the storytelling. He found the title of "Dune Part I{{Sic}}" to be "presumptuous", regarding it to be analogous to how other film franchises advertise future installments. Gleiberman felt the film's spectacles, including the sandworm and ornithopter sequences, disengage him from the story, saying "as the movie begins to run out of tricks, it turns woozy and amorphous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |author-link=Owen Gleiberman |date=September 3, 2021 |title='Dune' Review: Spectacular and Engrossing…Until It Isn't |url=https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/dune-review-spectacular-and-engrossing-until-it-isnt-1235051928/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210919232604/https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/dune-review-spectacular-and-engrossing-until-it-isnt-1235051928/ |archive-date=September 19, 2021 |access-date=September 24, 2021 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the film for ''[[TheWrap]]'', Steve Pond noted the film's darker tone had remained consistent, and cited the production design and scope as positive elements. Pond enjoyed the action sequences on Arrakis and appreciated that Villeneuve "finds some dark poetry in the way he plays up the story’s mystical elements". However, he was mixed on the film's dark tone, regarding it as a tonal deviation from his previous films but also allowing it to be "giant mood piece that can be exhilarating in its dark beauty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pond |first=Steve |date=September 3, 2021 |title='Dune' Film Review: Huge Sci-Fi Epic Is Relentlessly Dark But Also Thrilling |url=https://www.thewrap.com/dune-film-review-timothee-chalamet/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910145115/https://www.thewrap.com/dune-film-review-timothee-chalamet/ |archive-date=September 10, 2021 |access-date=September 6, 2021 |website=[[TheWrap]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators and academics perceived the film to have neglected and [[Cultural appropriation|appropriated]] Arabian and Islamic elements which influenced ''Dune'', citing the lack of [[MENA|Middle Eastern or North African]] (MENA) actors.&lt;ref name="VLT-20211029"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hadadi |first=Roxana |date=October 29, 2021 |title=''Dune'' Has a Desert Problem |work=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] |url=https://www.vulture.com/2021/10/dune-has-a-desert-problem.html |url-status=live |url-access=limited |access-date=October 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211029215355/https://www.vulture.com/2021/10/dune-has-a-desert-problem.html |archive-date=October 29, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serena Rasoul, founder of [[Muslim Casting]], wanted more MENA representation and labelled the lack of MENA actors an "erasure".
